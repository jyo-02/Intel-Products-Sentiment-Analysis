intel-i3-10100,pcmag,"As the entry-level Core chip in Intel's 10th Generation lineup of desktop CPUs, the Core i3-10100 ($122) finds itself parachuting into a marketplace battlefield. AMD's Ryzen 3 3300X ($120) has been busy swatting members of Intel's current lineup of gaming-focused CPUs out of the sky on value, as well as in performance with lightly threaded games. So, how does the Core i3-10100 do in the face of such firepower? It takes cover...mostly. The Core i3-10100 is sometimes slower than its predecessor, the Core i3-9100, and the 3300X has proven itself to be a four-core CPU that punches above its weight in popular games, making it a hot pick for cost-conscious PC builders and buyers. Unless you need onboard graphics or must be on Intel's LGA 1200 socket, the Ryzen 3 3300X is categorically a better choice (and if you do need onboard graphics, the $99 AMD Ryzen 3 3200G might finish the fight). Otherwise, in those limited scenarios, the Core i3-10100 fulfills its role within Intel's stack dutifully enough. The Ryzen 3 3300X and 3200G just do it better, for the money, in AMD's. To start off our discussion of the Intel Core i3-10100 and where it sits against AMD's lineup of entry-level CPUs, let's look at some of basic specs of both... The four-core/eight-thread Intel Core i3-10100 lands in the 10th Gen stack as Intel's entry-level Core CPU, the next step up from a Celeron or a Pentium. And at least on paper, it looks like an upgrade in every way from the Intel Core i3-9100 for the same price. On the street the processor is both widely available at the time of publish (not something we can say for the AMD Ryzen 3 3300X), and also going for cheaper than Intel's original recommended $122 selling price (between $110 and $120, depending where you shop). The chip also adds back in a critical feature that was missing from several 9th Generation Intel desktop chips, including the Core i3-9100: Hyper-Threading. The Intel Core i3-10100 now supports up to eight threads across its four cores, but, as we discovered in our benchmarking the return of that feature in 10th Generation (specifically at this tier of CPU), it may not be the welcome-back gift we were hoping for. Now it's time to talk about the LGA 1200-pound gorilla in the room. Sure, Intel's insistence on demanding yet another platform upgrade out of its users as a part of its move to 10th Generation in 2020 might make sense at the level of the $488 ($549 street) Intel Core i9-10900K, or even the midrange (around-$275) Intel Core i5-10600K, depending on the features you need. But for the Core i3 price tier? A new motherboard could end up costing more than the chip itself! As a part of the move from LGA 1151 to LGA 1200, the Intel Core i3-10100 is only compatible with motherboards that use one of the following new-for-2020 chipsets: Intel B460, H410, H470, or Z490. (It should also work with the LGA 1200-based boards for the coming 11th Generation ""Rocket Lake"" processors.) There are a number of budget-chipset options available in that lineup, but budget or otherwise, it's hard to stand up to what AMD is offering on platform compatibility these days. Just for starters, the AMD Ryzen 5 3400G, Ryzen 3 3200G, and Ryzen 3 3300X are all compatible with the same socket: Socket AM4. That same courtesy stretches up and down through many members of the Zen family, but for the sake of processors under $150, the difference between ""upgrading today"" and ""not yet"" can often hinge on the cost of a new motherboard between generations...or whether you need one at all. To offset some of the cost benefits either the AMD Ryzen 3 3100 or Ryzen 3 3300X might have over Intel at this price, the Core i3-10100 hits back with the inclusion of its UHD Graphics 630 integrated graphics processor (IGP), eliminating the need for a separate video card. This more fairly puts the Core i3-10100 in competition with the $99 ""Zen+""-based AMD Ryzen 3 3200G or the around-$150 AMD Ryzen 5 3400G on either side, with their Radeon RX Vega 8 and RX Vega 11 IGPs, respectively. (These AMD chips, mind you, are thin on the ground at those prices in early 2021 due to supply issues.) Intel includes its familiar, basic stock cooler in every Core i3-10100 box, which makes sense at this CPU tier. Oftentimes, buyers of processors under $200 (and especially those purchasing CPUs with an IGP) just want something they can install in one shot and not have to think about. In that role, Intel's stock cooler handles the job just fine. Gamers might still want to saddle up with something slightly beefier, but it will do the job. We tested the Core i3-10100 on an Asus ROG Maximus XII Hero (Wi-Fi) motherboard, with 16GB of G.Skill memory clocked to 3,000MHz (for comparability with our earlier CPU reviews), and an Intel SATA boot SSD paired with an ADATA SATA M.2 secondary drive. All this was packed in ADATA's XPG Invader chassis, fitted with a Deepcool GamerStorm Captain 240 EX 240mm liquid cooler and a 750-watt Corsair power supply. For our gaming tests, we used an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, at Founders Edition clocks, as we have on all recent mainstream and high-end CPU reviews. We test CPUs using a variety of synthetic benchmarks that offer proprietary scores, as well as real-world tests using consumer apps like 7-Zip, and 3D games such as Far Cry 5. For chips at the tier of the Intel Core i3-10100, we also run several games on the IGP. Included in the charts below is a variety of like-priced competing and sibling AMD and Intel CPUs, as well as some much higher-end ones for context. The Intel Core i3-10100 isn't meant to be a multi-threaded rock star on this particular stage, but a few of the tests are still important metrics for users who perform single-threaded tasks often. On single-threaded tasks the Intel Core i3-10100 performed well, but oddly seemed to struggle against its predecessor, the Intel Core i3-9100, depending on the benchmark. Despite having four more threads to work with compared to the i3-9100, the i3-10100 couldn't beat the chip it's meant to replace regularly enough to walk out as a unanimous victor. That's to say nothing of the beating that the i3-10100 takes from the Ryzen 3 3300X. (In the Core i3's favor, you can actually buy one without hiring a search party to find it.) However, it does manage to keep pace with (or set a new one against) the Radeon Vega-IGP-equipped AMD Ryzen 3 3200G, depending on the run, and that chip might be considered a fairer comparison. Here's what we saw in our bank of gaming tests with our GeForce RTX 2080 Ti card running the show. This top-end consumer graphics card is the primary arbiter of performance at 4K with all of the CPUs that we have laid out below. At 1080p, though, the card gets out of the way a bit more and lets the CPU differences shine.  Does the Intel Core i3-10100 do its job here (which is to say, powering games in 1080p and 4K at reasonably high frame rates)? Sure! Does the AMD Ryzen 3 3300X do it better at almost every turn? Also sure. And while some of the wins often come down to the indistinguishable wire on frames, factoring in the almost certainly mandatory cost of upgrading to an LGA 1200 motherboard (versus some of the cheapest B350 or B450 boards that are available), the price-to-performance ratio inevitably skews back to AMD's favor. As a low-end chip, the Intel Core i3-10100 is often looked at as both a chip that can power games alongside a discrete graphics card, as well as a chip that can run the show all on its own with the help of its onboard Intel UHD Graphics 630. We run lower end CPUs that have IGPs through a series of games tuned to either near-lowest, or the lowest, settings at 1,280 by 720 pixel resolution (720p), as well as at 1,920 by 1,080 pixels (1080p). Well...that's not great for Intel's Core i3. The Ryzen 3 3200G, while not comparatively the best deal against its older brother, the Ryzen 5 3400G, looks like a downright steal compared to the Core i3-10100, if you'll be relying on the AMD chip's Radeon Graphics IGP for gaming. The Ryzen 3 3200G, as its own budget gaming engine, regularly comes within spitting distance of hitting 60fps in 1080p, and it even manages to cross the boundary in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, versus the Intel Core i3-10100's result of just 35fps in the same benchmark. The Night Raid 3DMark run shows just how much work AMD has put into elevating its APUs in the past several years from afterthoughts into serious contenders. Both the Ryzen 3200G and 3400G smash through this synthetic run, and provide one of the starkest examples of the limits of Intel's older UHD Graphics options in today's climate. While the Intel Core i3-10100 never crested above a balmy 46 degrees C during our testing, we should emphasize that our cooling solution was incredibly overkill for the job. We didn't run any tests on the stock cooler, since using that is outside of our standard testing regimen. However, as a four-core processor it's unlikely that the Core i3-10100 will be setting off alarms in your system anytime soon if you allow for even modest airflow. As the Core i3-10100 is a non-""K"" chipâwhich is to say, ""not overclockable""âwe didn't get a chance to see what the Core i3-10100 could do without Intel's anti-overclocking shackles on its wrists. If you want to overclock a processor at this level, the Ryzen 3 3300X and its unlocked clock speed will be the way to go. As a chip meant to fill what is debatably one of the largest volume-seller roles in every chip launchâthe entry-level optionâthe Intel Core i3-10100 shows just the tough spot that its 10th Generation desktop silicon has left Intel in price, value, and performance. The results above show off the pinnacle of what the Core i3-10100 should be capable of at stock, given the deluxe testbed it was slotted into, and it still came in well under the new standard set by AMD and its Zen-based CPUs and APUs. Granted, those chips were also tested on beefy AM4 motherboards attached to liquid cooling systems that cost as much as or more than the CPUâbut we digress. If you want a chip that will far outstrip the Core i3-10100 in gaming results with a dedicated GPU, the Ryzen 3 3100 and Ryzen 3300X provide consistently faster competition in nearly every metric we test on. If money is the only thing on your mind (but you also gotta have Intel), we'd recommend putting your savings savvy to work before opting for the Core i3-10100 upgrade. If you have an older-generation board, pair it with an Intel Core i3-9100 instead, which in our tests was often just as good (and sometimes better) than the Core i3-10100 in multi-core runs. Or look further up the stack at a Core i5. As an IGP-equipped CPU for everyday work, the Core i3-10100 will serve its duties just fine, but as a ""gaming"" solution, it left us wanting. The Ryzen 3 3200G with its Radeon RX Vega 8 graphics far outstripped the capabilities of the Core i3-10100's UHD Graphics in IGP testing, and that's to say nothing of the smackdown we saw out of Vega 11 with the Ryzen 5 3400G. Perhaps Intel's 11th Generation Core ""Rocket Lake"" desktop CPUs, likely appearing in March 2021, will see a low-end renaissance for Intel and its new processors. But until then, we'd recommend staying the course with AMD at this price point, and going with any of the options mentioned above before sticking on the Intel Core i3-10100. They're worth the hunt. Intel's entry-level Core i3-10100 CPU requires an all-new motherboard platform to install, and our sample chip's performance numbers are far enough below AMD's competing Ryzens to stifle most of its four-core appeal.

intel-i3-10100,tomshardware,"The Core i3-10100F is poised to be the new budget gaming champion. The 14nm Comet Lake chip arrives with four cores and eight threads clocked at 3.6 GHz and a boost clock speed of 4.3 GHz. With a 65W TDP (thermal power design), the quad-core part has relatively low cooling requirements, which is good news for budget builders. As the ""F"" suffix in the model name indicates, the Core i3-10100F lacks integrated graphics. The processor won't miss it anyway since it's aimed at the gaming crowd that'll likely pair the chip with a discrete gaming graphics card. According to Intel, the Core i3-10100F will retail for between $79 and $97; however, the chipmaker doesn't state when the quad-core processor will hit the retail channels. Like the Core i3-10100F, the Ryzen 3 3300X doesn't have integrated graphics. The Zen 2 processor also competes in the 65W category, so it's the perfect opponent for the Core i3-10100F. AMD includes the Wraith Stealth CPU cooler with the Ryzen 3 3300X, while Intel probably delivers the Core i3-10100F with the same nameless stock heatsink the chipmaker has been using all these years. While the Ryzen 3 3300X was available for a short period after launch, it has been out of stock pretty much everywhere for roughly five months. It remains to be seen whether the Core i3-10100F can match the Ryzen 3 3300X in gaming performance. If it does, Intel has a sure winner on its hands if the chipmaker can provide sufficient supply.

intel-i3-12100F,pcmag,"Mid-tower PC cases dominate budget desktop shopping, but why not go smaller? Starting at $329 ($471 as tested), the MSI Pro DP21 is a mini PC that holds just as much capability in about one-tenth the space. Compact enough for VESA mounting behind a monitor or under a desk, it nevertheless has plenty of ports, Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth wireless connectivity, and a perky Intel Core i3 processor. The ECS Liva Z3 and Intel NUC 12 Pro are even smaller, but neither balances price and performance as well as the Pro DP21. With that, this mini MSI easily earns an Editors' Choice award among budget mini PCs. MSI's Pro DP21 is aimed at home and business users with everyday needs such as office productivity, web surfing or video streaming, and point-of-sale operations. Our entry-level review unit has a quad-core Intel Core i3-12100 processor, 8GB of memory, a 256GB solid-state drive (SSD), and Windows 11 Home. The PC is ready to run out of the box and includes a basic USB keyboard and mouse. All you'll need to add is a monitor. This PC's no-nonsense case measures 2.2 by 8 by 8.2 inches (HWD), which works out to a volume of just 2.3 liters. That's almost nothing when you consider a typical mid-tower is around 30 liters. As mentioned, the Pro DP21 supports VESA mounting, allowing you to put it behind a monitor, on a wall, or even attached to the underside of your desk. If you don't want to mount it, that's fine; it can lie horizontally or be placed vertically in its included stand. Design-wise, the Pro DP21 won't attract second glances, though its front panel makes an attempt at standing out with plastic ridges for definition and a silver MSI logo. Ports up front include 3.5mm headphone and microphone jacks and four retro USB 2.0 ports. The power button glows white when the system is powered on. Around the back, you'll find HDMI 2.0b and DisplayPort video outputs, each supporting 4K at 60Hz for a modern dual-monitor setup. In addition to those are Gigabit Ethernet, serial, three USB Type-A (two versions of 3.2 Gen 1 and one 3.2 Gen 2), one USB Type-C (3.2 Gen 2), and microphone-in and line-out audio jacks. A final connector accommodates the laptop-style 120-watt AC adapter, as this desktop is simply too small for an internal power supply. This little desktop allows for commendable serviceability. Removing two Philips screws lets you slide the top panel rearward. The 6.5-inch-square motherboard has everything in plain sight, including an M.2 2280 slot for SSDs, an M.2 2230 wireless card slot, and two DDR4-3200 SO-DIMM slots for up to 64GB of RAM (two 32GB modules). The included Intel AX201 wireless card supports Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2. Its antenna is built into the chassis. Two 2.5-inch storage drives can be installed in the metal cage above the memory slots. Even the Pro DP21's processor can be upgraded; the motherboard supports socketed FCLGA1700 Intel ""Alder Lake"" CPUs with a 65-watt base power rating. Mini PCs often resort to non-upgradable mobile chips, so this is a pleasant surprise. Cooling needs are minimal in a PC this small. The fan atop the CPU heatsink is the only one in this unit; it stays quiet even under intense use. To recap, our $471 MSI Pro DP21 (model 12M-407US) features an Intel Core i3-12100 CPU (four 3.3GHz Performance cores, no Efficient cores, eight threads), Intel UHD 730 integrated graphics, 8GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD, and Windows 11 Home. The warranty is one year, and a USB-wired keyboard and mouse accompany the bundled stand. I briefly saw the system for sale for $429 on Amazon. MSI's low price and desktop CPU are a rare combo in the mini PC segment. Performance-wise, it competes with small-form-factor PCs, such as the Acer Aspire TC-1760-UA92 ($559 as tested with a Core i5-12400). Mini PCs in the vicinity include the palm-sized ECS Liva Z3, which is inexpensive ($250) but hobbled by a weak Intel Pentium Silver CPU. We also have the Geekom IT8 Mini PC ($549), which uses an older-but-capable, laptop-grade Core i5-8265U chip. Neither of them is as upgrade-friendly as the Pro DP21. In addition to these PCs, we include benchmark results for the $1,064 Intel NUC 12 Pro powered by a laptop-grade Core i7-1260P. You can see the contenders' basic specs in the table below. Our first test is UL's PCMark 10, which simulates a variety of real-world productivity and office workflows to measure overall performance for everyday apps ranging from word processing and spreadsheet work to videoconferencing. It also includes a storage subtest for the primary drive. Three other benchmarks focus on the CPU, using all available cores and threads, to rate a PC's suitability for processor-intensive workloads. Maxon's Cinebench R23 uses that company's Cinema 4D engine to render a complex scene, while Primate Labs' Geekbench 5.4 Pro simulates popular apps ranging from PDF rendering and speech recognition to machine learning. Finally, we use the open-source video transcoder HandBrake 1.4 to convert a 12-minute video clip from 4K to 1080p resolution (lower times are better). Our final productivity test is Puget Systems' PugetBench for Photoshop, which uses the Creative Cloud version 22 of Adobe's famous image editor to rate a PC's performance for content creation and multimedia applications. It's an automated extension that executes a variety of general and GPU-accelerated Photoshop tasks ranging from opening, rotating, resizing, and saving an image to applying masks, gradient fills, and filters. MSI's desktop posts a PCMark 10 score that clears the 4,000-point hurdle signifying excellent performance for Microsoft Office 365 and Google Workspace, outdoing the Geekom and the underpowered Liva Z3. The Pro DP21 also puts up healthy numbers in the CPU benchmarks, coming close to the six-core Acer in Geekbench. Adobe Photoshop is not this mini PC's strong suit, but with more RAM it probably would have fared better. For Windows PCs, our synthetic gaming tests include two DirectX 12 gaming simulations from UL's 3DMark, Night Raid (more modest, suitable for systems with integrated graphics) and Time Spy (more demanding, suitable for gaming rigs with discrete GPUs). Also looped into that group is the cross-platform GPU benchmark GFXBench 5, which we use to gauge OpenGL performance. MSI's Pro DP21 does about as well as can be expected from a desktop with Intel UHD integrated graphicsâin other words, it won't be playing the latest games anytime soon. Intel's NUC 12 Pro, with later-generation Iris Xe graphics, scores considerably better in these tests, as an example. In short, the Pro DP21 exemplifies what value-oriented mini PCs should be all about. Its current connectivity, including Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetoothâand its impressive upgrade potentialâmake the Pro DP21 a viable alternative to small-form-factor towers, and its desktop-grade Intel processor is much more responsive than many mobile CPUs. For less than $500 as tested, you can't go wrong with the MSI Pro DP21, earning a well-deserved Editors' Choice among budget mini PCs. MSI's budget-friendly, desk-space-saving Pro DP21 mini PC delivers plenty of performance, lots of wired connectivity, and Wi-Fi 6 for a low price.

intel-i3-12100F,tomshardware,"That leaves Intel unchecked in the budget segment, adding to the company's newfound dominance with the Alder Lake chips that even outperform more expensive Ryzen 5000 chips. Intel's advantages also extend to the motherboard ecosystem too, with B660 and H610 motherboards providing a great pairing for the Core i3-12100. So even though these boards do cost more than we're accustomed to for the lowest-end models, they provide plenty of connectivity for budget systems. Overall, the quad-core i3-12100's potent combination of price, performance, and improved stock cooler dominates the $100 to $130 price range while punching up against more expensive competitors. "

As a low-end chip, the Intel Core i3-10100 is often looked at as both a chip that can power games alongside a discrete graphics card, as well as a chip that can run the show all on its own with the help of its onboard Intel UHD Graphics 630. We run lower end CPUs that have IGPs through a series of games tuned to either near-lowest, or the lowest, settings at 1,280 by 720 pixel resolution (720p), as well as at 1,920 by 1,080 pixels (1080p). Well...that's not great for Intel's Core i3. The Ryzen 3 3200G, while not comparatively the best deal against its older brother, the Ryzen 5 3400G, looks like a downright steal compared to the Core i3-10100, if you'll be relying on the AMD chip's Radeon Graphics IGP for gaming. The Ryzen 3 3200G, as its own budget gaming engine, regularly comes within spitting distance of hitting 60fps in 1080p, and it even manages to cross the boundary in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, versus the Intel Core i3-10100's result of just 35fps in the same benchmark. The Night Raid 3DMark run shows just how much work AMD has put into elevating its APUs in the past several years from afterthoughts into serious contenders. Both the Ryzen 3200G and 3400G smash through this synthetic run, and provide one of the starkest examples of the limits of Intel's older UHD Graphics options in today's climate. While the Intel Core i3-10100 never crested above a balmy 46 degrees C during our testing, we should emphasize that our cooling solution was incredibly overkill for the job. We didn't run any tests on the stock cooler, since using that is outside of our standard testing regimen. However, as a four-core processor it's unlikely that the Core i3-10100 will be setting off alarms in your system anytime soon if you allow for even modest airflow. As the Core i3-10100 is a non-""K"" chipâwhich is to say, ""not overclockable""âwe didn't get a chance to see what the Core i3-10100 could do without Intel's anti-overclocking shackles on its wrists. If you want to overclock a processor at this level, the Ryzen 3 3300X and its unlocked clock speed will be the way to go. As a chip meant to fill what is debatably one of the largest volume-seller roles in every chip launchâthe entry-level optionâthe Intel Core i3-10100 shows just the tough spot that its 10th Generation desktop silicon has left Intel in price, value, and performance. The results above show off the pinnacle of what the Core i3-10100 should be capable of at stock, given the deluxe testbed it was slotted into, and it still came in well under the new standard set by AMD and its Zen-based CPUs and APUs. Granted, those chips were also tested on beefy AM4 motherboards attached to liquid cooling systems that cost as much as or more than the CPUâbut we digress. If you want a chip that will far outstrip the Core i3-10100 in gaming results with a dedicated GPU, the Ryzen 3 3100 and Ryzen 3300X provide consistently faster competition in nearly every metric we test on. If money is the only thing on your mind (but you also gotta have Intel), we'd recommend putting your savings savvy to work before opting for the Core i3-10100 upgrade. If you have an older-generation board, pair it with an Intel Core i3-9100 instead, which in our tests was often just as good (and sometimes better) than the Core i3-10100 in multi-core runs. Or look further up the stack at a Core i5. As an IGP-equipped CPU for everyday work, the Core i3-10100 will serve its duties just fine, but as a ""gaming"" solution, it left us wanting. The Ryzen 3 3200G with its Radeon RX Vega 8 graphics far outstripped the capabilities of the Core i3-10100's UHD Graphics in IGP testing, and that's to say nothing of the smackdown we saw out of Vega 11 with the Ryzen 5 3400G. Perhaps Intel's 11th Generation Core ""Rocket Lake"" desktop CPUs, likely appearing in March 2021, will see a low-end renaissance for Intel and its new processors. But until then, we'd recommend staying the course with AMD at this price point, and going with any of the options mentioned above before sticking on the Intel Core i3-10100. They're worth the hunt. Intel's entry-level Core i3-10100 CPU requires an all-new motherboard platform to install, and our sample chip's performance numbers are far enough below AMD's competing Ryzens to stifle most of its four-core appeal.

intel-i3-13100,tomshardware,"The Intel Core i3-13100F comes to market with big shoes to fill; its predecessor, the Core i3-12100F, built a reputation as the best budget CPU for gaming. Intel is obviously looking to repeat that success, but perhaps the Core i3-13100F follows in the footsteps of its predecessor too closely - the company repurposed the previous-gen design for the Core i3-13100, so it has the same four p-cores paired with an ever-so-slightly-improved 200 MHz higher boost clock of 4.5 GHz.The 13100F addresses the sub-$150 budget segment, so pricing is critical. However, while Intel launched the previous-gen graphics-less Core i3-12100F at $104, it later quietly raised pricing. So naturally, that leads to higher prices for the new Core i3 models, too. As such, Intel's recommended pricing has jumped to $144 for the full-fledged Core i3-13100 model and $119 for the graphics-less 13100F model. That's a 12% and 15% gen-on-gen price increase, respectively.Meanwhile, AMD might have moved forward to its new AM5 platform for its high-end Zen 4 Ryzen 7000 chips, but it also refreshed its Zen 3 Ryzen 5000 lineup to address the lower end of the market with its AM4 motherboards. The new Zen 3 processors initially arrived with slightly higher price tags than expected, but they now represent an exceptional value at their current pricing.That leaves Intel's quad-core chip battling two six-core processors: The $144 Core i3-13100 faces stiff competition from the $140 Ryzen 5 5600, while the $119 Core i3-13100F squares off with the $99 Ryzen 5 5500. Both AMD chips drop into the inexpensive and plentiful AM4 chipset ecosystem, giving builders plenty of affordable options for budget builds, thus creating a fierce contest for a spot on the list of best CPUs for gaming. Let's see how the Core i3-13100F stands up to the pressure.Retail pricing for AMD and Intel's chips now diverges widely from suggested pricing, so here we've listed the latest street prices. Intel has used re-badged silicon for its lower-end chips in the past, and continues that practice with its new lineup. So while the new Core i3 models slot into the 13th-Gen Raptor Lake family, Intel re-uses the previous-gen 12th-Gen Alder Lake 'Intel 7' silicon and Golden Cove core architecture. Intel also takes this approach with some of the Core i5 models, like the Core i5-13400.As such, outside of some microcode tuning, the 13100 is identical to the 12100. That is evident from the L2 cache capacity, which weighs in at 1.25 MB per core for the 13100. In contrast, the truly new Raptor Cove cores come with 2MB per core.Like its predecessor, the Core i3-13100/F comes with four performance cores and eight threads, but no e-cores for background tasks. Intel sprinkled on 200 MHz of extra boost frequency (+5%), bringing it to 4.5 GHz, and 100 MHz higher base clock (+3%), bringing it to 4.3 GHz. The clock speed adjustments are all that Intel has to justify the step up to 13th-Gen branding and the much higher price tag. As before, the 13100 has a 60W / 89W processor base/max turbo power, 16 PCIe 5.0 lanes and four PCIe 4.0 lanes, and support up to DDR4-3200 and DDR5-4800 MT/s (caveats apply to DDR5 support). Intel's non-K models don't allow overclocking the CPU cores, but they do support memory overclocking. Unfortunately, the company's nonsensical decision to keep certain voltages locked restricts DDR4's overclocking headroom, so gains are limited.The standard Core i3-13100 comes with the UHD Graphics 730 engine and 24 EUs that run at 300/1500 MHz base/boost frequencies. You can save some cash by going without graphics with the F-series model, but that means you will lose Quick Sync capabilities and the iGPU fallback that you can use for troubleshooting. Otherwise, the chips provide the same performance.The 13100 models drop into either 600- or 700-series motherboards and come with a bundled Laminar RM1 cooler that is sufficient for cooling the chip under normal conditions, albeit at the expense of a higher noise level than you'd get with a better cooler.The six-core 12-thread Ryzen 5 5600 is a 7nm Vermeer model that debuted at $199, but its new $140 price point makes a lot more sense. This chip is the non-X version of the Ryzen 5 5600X, so the two chips are nearly identical besides the 5600's reduced 3.5 / 4.4 GHz base/boost clock. Overall, the 5600 has the same feature set we see with other chiplet-based Zen 3 chips.AMD's lowest-end Zen 3 chip, the Ryzen 5 5500, debuted at $150 but now retails for a mere $99. For this chip, AMD repurposed its monolithic (single-chip) Cezanne silicon that it typically uses for APUs, but disabled the chips integrated Radeon Vega graphics engine. That leaves us with a six-core 12-thread chip that looks and largely acts like a standard Vermeer processor.The 5500 has the same design as the Ryzen 5 5600G, including support for PCIe 3.0 instead of PCIe 4.0. As a result, this chip will make a great pairing for older, lower-end AM4 motherboards (you definitely dont want to pay for functionality you dont need by pairing it with a PCIe 4.0-supporting motherboard). The 5500 wields a 3.6 / 4.2 GHz base/boost clock.In contrast to the locked Core i3 lineup, the Ryzen chips are fully unlocked for overclocking the CPU cores, memory, and fabric, and like their more full-fledged counterparts, both chips come with a bundled Wraith Stealth cooler that is sufficient for stock operation. They also support up to DDR4-3200 memory. Neither chip has a functional iGPU, so you'll need to plan for a discrete GPU. "
intel-i5-10400,pcmag,"Intel's Core i5-10400 ($182) is not the company's flagship six-core desktop CPU in its 10th Generation stack. (That honor goes to the unlocked Core i5-10600K, which we reviewed at launch last year.) But what the Core i5-10400 lacks in overclockability, it makes up for in tenacity. The chip stays in the race against AMD's onslaught of Editors' Choice-winning powerhouse six-core CPUs, like the Ryzen 5 5600X and last-generation 3600X. The Core is a solid value pick for those who already own an LGA 1200 motherboard and are looking to game with a discrete GPU. But strictly as a midrange upgrade, AMD's Ryzen 5 chips make more sense in both cost-per-core and overall performanceâif you can get one near list price. As a rare Intel value play, the Core i5-10400 is a decent bet for PC gamers and mainstream users if AMD Ryzen 3000 and 5000 chips stay hard to get and/or inflated in price. To elaborate on our introduction, Intel's move to the LGA 1200 socket with its ""Comet Lake"" 10th Generation desktop chips saps much of the Core i5-10400's value proposition, since you need to get a new motherboard for it. That's in contrast with AMD's ubiquitous support of Socket AM4 with its mainstream Ryzen CPUs. Boards with that socket, through a host of chipsets, have been on the market for years now, and you may already own one. That is not likely in the case of Intel's new boards, and that dampens the value proposition of lower-end chips. The Core i5's performance doesn't do enough to justify a standalone upgrade in an existing board unless, for some unlikely reason, you happen to own an LGA 1200 board equipped with a 2020-release of a Pentium Gold or Core i3 chip. Speaking of the uphill battle that Intel has been fighting against AMD on the desktop, let's start off our discussion of the Intel Core i5-10400 and where it sits against AMD's lineup of entry-level and midrange CPUs, priced around $150 to $300, by looking at some of basic specs of both... The six-core/12-thread Intel Core i5-10400 represents the low end of Intel's midrange options, and finds itself competing across the aisle with processors like AMD's Ryzen 3 3400G ($149), the Ryzen 3 3600 ($199), and the Ryzen 5 5600X ($299). The Ryzen 3 3400G is one of AMD's only chips in the same price range with integrated graphics; the others need a discrete video card. However, before we continue down the road of this review, we should mention some recent findings first. While it's standard protocol to rate a CPU on its MSRP or RCP (""recommended customer price,"" in Intel lingo), in the past few weeks (as of this writing in February 2021), the prices of 10th Generation Intel chips have been discounted somewhat at a number of online retailers. While the Intel Core i5-10400 lists for $182, you may find it between $150 and $160, depending on where you choose to shop. Even still, in my eyes, price cuts for this chip and other lower-end 10th Generation models may not outweigh the ultimate cost of adoption, which includes an LGA 1200 motherboard. AMD's continued lean into Socket AM4 has proven to be a boon for the company, giving a much wider swath of upgraders the opportunity to beef up their existing AMD systems with CPUs like the Ryzen 5 3600 at a fraction of the cost of getting an Intel Core i5-10400 system off the ground. Intel's insistence on refreshing its desktop sockets with such regularity has once again shot the company's budget-focused options in their metaphorical feet. Intel did make one smart power move with this chip and some others in the Comet Lake line: The Core i5-10400 sees the reintroduction of Hyper-Threading to its spec sheet. It bumped up the number of threads available from the Intel Core i5-9400 (six cores/six threads), to 12 processing threads off the six cores of the Core i5-10400. That's a big deal, to be sure, but practically a necessity to keep these Intel chips viable at this point versus the Ryzen juggernaut. Like many of the other chips in the Intel 10th Generation stack, the Core i5-10400 includes an Intel UHD Graphics 630 integrated graphics processor (IGP). AMD currently doesn't offer any processors with an IGP and more than four cores onboard in its 3000 or 5000 Series Ryzen lines, so the closest point of comparison on the Ryzen side is the four-core/eight-thread AMD Ryzen 5 3400G with its Vega 11 onboard graphics. That and its Ryzen 3 equivalent, the 3200G, haven't seen a move to the Zen 3 architecture and the Ryzen 50000 series. (Yet, anyway.) The Intel Core i5-10400 rests right around the cusp of where Intel stops including its stock coolers bundled in the box, and at this price point including one makes sense. This is not an overclocking CPU, so the fan in the box should suffice for almost everyone. At least everyone who doesn't have to look at this now old-school design through a clear case window. We tested the Core i5-10400 on an Asus ROG Maximus XII Hero (Wi-Fi) motherboard (a Z490-chipset board), with 16GB of G.Skill memory clocked to 3,000MHz (for comparability with our earlier CPU reviews), and an Intel SATA boot SSD paired with an ADATA SATA M.2 secondary drive. All this was packed in ADATA's XPG Invader chassis, fitted with a Deepcool GamerStorm Captain 240 EX 240mm liquid cooler and a 750-watt Corsair power supply. For our gaming tests, we used an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, at Founders Edition clocks, as we have on all recent mainstream and high-end CPU reviews. We test CPUs using a variety of synthetic benchmarks that offer proprietary scores, as well as real-world tests using consumer apps like 7-Zip, and 3D games such as Far Cry 5. For chips at the tier of the Intel Core i5-10400, we also run several games using the IGP alone, without a discrete video card. Included in the charts below is a variety of like-priced competing and sibling AMD and Intel CPUs. Over the last couple of years, Intel's midrange options have struggled against AMD's in productivity tasks. But how did the Core i5-10400, with its Hyper-Threading restored, fare once its threads were put to the test? About the same as the rest, unfortunately. Like-priced or slightly pricier AMD silicon (at least, if you compare on launch prices) continues to dominate in content creation and productivity tasks. The Ryzen 5 3600, the Ryzen 5 3600X, the Ryzen 5 3600XT, and the Ryzen 5 5600X are all superior six-core options for productivity when compared with the Core i5-10400 or even the Core i5-10600K, and key productivity benchmarks like 7-Zip plainly show the gap that exists between Intel and AMD in the six-core arena. The Core i5-10400 does decisively top the four-core, IGP-equipped Ryzen 5 3400G in all of the CPU tests; park that thought for moment. Here's what we saw in our bank of gaming tests with our GeForce RTX 2080 Ti card running the show. This top-end consumer graphics card is the primary arbiter of performance at 4K with all of the CPUs that we have laid out below. At 1080p, though, the card gets out of the way a bit more and lets the CPU differences shine.  One of the primary buyers we see for the Core i5-10400 are midrange gamers who either already own a discrete GPU to pair with their processor, or who are planning to buy one alongside the Core i5-10400 as a part of their new build. And they'll likely be running at 1080p, not 4K. In this run of tests, the Core i5-10400 is competitive, if outshined by the Ryzen 3 3300X on value, and the Ryzen 5 5600X on performance. Compare the 5600X's results against the Ryzen 5 3600X from last generation; you can see the huge gains AMD has made with frame rates with the Zen 3 architecture. The Core i5 chip does score some surprising wins in a few of our legacy game tests (the Bioshock: Infinite results are especially eyebrow-raising), but they are fewer than Intel needs to walk away with a decisive victory here. As a midrange chip, the Intel Core i5-10400 straddles the line as a chip that can power games along with a discrete GPU, as well as a chip that can run the show all on its own with the help of its onboard Intel UHD Graphics 630. We run lower-end CPUs that have IGPs through a series of games tuned to either near-lowest, or the lowest, settings at a 1,280-by-720-pixel resolution (720p), as well as at 1,920 by 1,080 pixels (1080p). Well, at least the IGP here is better than what's on a last-gen Pentium or Celeron. Intel's venerable UHD Graphics 630 silicon has been showing its age for some time now, but nowhere is that contrast more obvious than when stacked up against AMD's Radeon RX Vega integrated silicon. Both the Vega 8 and Vega 11 IGPs (in the AMD Ryzen 3 3200G and Ryzen 5 3400G, respectively) have proven themselves to be solid options for anyone looking to work and play all off of the same chip on a very tight budget. While Intel's coming 11th Generation ""Rocket Lake"" CPUs may bring the promise of fresh Iris Xe IGP silicon (and hopefully boosted frame rates) to go along with them, until then Intel's UHD Graphics 630 should be avoided for pure gaming. UHD Graphics works fine for productivity use, but it's far from a gaming solution. Note that on the IGP, the Core i5-10400 did slightly worse against the Core i3-10100 in tests like Rainbow Six: Siege and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, an unexpected result given the price and performance difference between the two chips. (The much higher base clock on the Core i3, at 3.6GHz versus 2.9GHz on the Core i5, may have helped there.) While the Intel Core i5-10400 never topped 57 degrees C in our testing, that's likely down to our overkill cooling system used in our testbed. If you plan to cool the Core i5-10400 on air (which, unless you happen to have an idle AIO liquid cooler hanging around, we recommend at this price level), expect higher temperatures, though likely not by too much. As the Core i5-10400 is a non-""K""-series chip (a ""K"" suffix designates an overclockable CPU in Intel's line), we didn't get a chance to see what the Core i5-10400 could do in an overclocked profile. Those looking for a six-core Intel-based option that can have its boost clocks pushed up will need to opt for the Intel Core i5-10600K mentioned up top. As a cheaper alternative to the Intel Core i5-10600K, the Core i5-10400 slots right into its expected spot in the mainstream CPU hierarchy. If you want a six-core 10th Generation Intel processor with slightly more productivity potential and some overclockability, the Core i5-10600K is your chip. However, if you're trying to shave down costs and don't expect to overclock, the Core i5-10400 will still get the job done for about 35% less. In a vacuum, the Intel Core i5-10400 is solid for what it is, but as is tradition these days, when stacked up against the bevy of options available from AMD, the Core i5-10400 wilts under the pressure. The Ryzen 5 3600X is superb, albeit pricey and tricky to get, but even the last-gen Ryzen 5 3600 and 3600X are almost universally better picks than the Core i5-10400 (as well as the Core i5-10600K). That is both for their raw CPU performance and for their far-reaching motherboard compatibility. Meanwhile, budget-minded gamers playing on a discrete GPU will be better served by the $120 Ryzen 3 3300X (if you can find one for anywhere near that price, that is) or the $99 Ryzen 3 3100 (ditto that). Finally, the Ryzen 3 3200G and Ryzen 5 3400G, despite having two fewer cores than the Core i5-10400, regularly outperform the Core i5 in gaming on their IGPs by a significant margin (and remember; they're both compatible with AM4). If on-the-cheap, no-video-card gaming is what you are after, it is no contest. The Intel Core i5-10400 doesn't fit into any category as an outright winner, and even the recent price softness we have seen for some 10th Generation chips in Intel's stack won't be enough to elevate the chip beyond its station. The strong demand for, inflated prices of, and spotty availability of recent Ryzens keep the Core i5 viable at 3.5 stars here in early 2021. Let's hope that Intel's Rocket Lake-based equivalent (just spitballing here, let's guess it'll be a Core i5-11400?) can finally beat, or at least meet, AMD at its own game. Upgrading to any ""Comet Lake"" CPU (and its new platform) has its budget implications, but for a six-core chip with gaming chops, the Core i5-10400 is as good as it gets in Intel's 10th Generation stack.

intel-i5-10400,tomshardware,"The results were as follows:  In single-threaded applications, the new Comet Lake chip hardly showed any performance gains over the 9th Gen Coffee Lake chip, edging out with a performance increase of just 4-8%.  However, in multi-threaded tests the i5-10400 performed significantly better with improvements of up to 45%. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Of course, as with any pre-release data, you'll have to take these results with a grain of salt. But the numbers reported do make sense. We weren't expecting groundbreaking differences from Intel's new CPUs in the mid-segment. It's at the high-end where Intel is pushing the thermal envelopes of the Comet Lake CPUs to their absolute limits. That's where we expect things to get interesting. "
intel-i5-10600K,pcmag,"In late May, Intel stepped on the gas and released not one, not two, but an entirely new stack of 10th Generation ""Comet Lake-S"" desktop processors, including the company's top entry into the midrange-enthusiast/mainstream segment, the Core i5-10600K. This processor carries the ""K"" moniker, which indicates that it is unlocked for overclocking. It's born into a tough spot, though: Its high price (expected to be around $275; more on that in a bit) and the shape of the competition may offset whatever gains you might eke from your tweaks. If you want the fastest midrange gaming chip out there, from a pure high-refresh-gaming perspective, the Intel Core i5-10600K is technically the CPU for you. But on actual value and real-world usage, it can't quite compete with what AMD's already laid out on the table. We haven't had the opportunity to test the not-unlocked Core i5-10600, also released as part of this wave, but we suspect that chip may carry better value for the money if you're not insistent on overclocking. (It has a likely estimated price of about $50 less, though a much lower base clock.) We have a full breakdown of the larger Intel 10th Generation stack and all the new (read: relatively few) features that are coming along with it on a platform basis; you can check those out in our review of the flagship Intel Core i9-10900K here. In short? The company has crammed a few more cores into various tiers of its lineup while slightly dropping the price. But overall, the cost of upgrading to the overclocker-friendly Z490 platform is a concern versus AMD and its mature AM4 socket, for which you may already own a compatible motherboard. (Cheap AM4 options abound, too.) The initial Z490 boards tend to be deluxe models, though cheaper B460, H470, and H410 boards are imminent. That said, this K chip is meant to be paired with a robust mainboard, if you're buying it for the tweaking. So that means Z490. The key chips on the AMD side of the aisle competing against the Core i5-10600K are AMD's Ryzen 5 3600 and Ryzen 5 3600X. Here's a quick summary of the three chips' main differences... One thing we didn't chart here is the process technology. This Core i5, like all of the other 10th Generation Intel Comet Lake-S chips, is based on the chip maker's 14nm lithography, in a further refinement dubbed ""14nm++."" That's in contrast to the 7nm ""Zen 2"" process AMD has employed since mid-2019 in its newest Ryzens. The Intel Core i5-10600K is a six-core/12-thread CPU with an Intel UHD Graphics 630 integrated graphics processor (IGP), a rather high TDP of 125 watts, and a 4.1GHz base clock. Intel claims the chip is capable of hitting 4.8GHz on both single-core and all-core tasks. It, like the rest of Intel's 10th Generation Core i5s, doesn't support the Turbo Boost Max 3.0 or Thermal Velocity Boost features we saw in the Core i9-10900K. The chip is compatible only with Intel's also-new LGA 1200 socket, which will be the centerpoint of new Z490, H410, B460, and H470 motherboards. The thing to bear in mind here, however, is that if you are opting for the i5-10600K with the express aim of overclocking, you will want to opt for a Z490 board, which will have the ""K"" chip support for overclocking and, with better boards, the more robust power handling needed to push a 125-watt CPU like this one to the limit. These boards started at about $160 at this writing and rose steadily from there. One thing to note in passing which we discuss in more detail in our Core i9-10900K review: These boards do not gain you support for higher-bandwidth PCI Express 4.0. AMD's newest X570 boards for its latest Ryzens, in contrast, do. Many of the new Z490 boards come ""PCI Express 4.0 ready,"" in essence suggesting that PCIe 4.0 support will come with next-generation LGA 1200 chips (code-named ""Rocket Lake-S""); Intel would not confirm that. But a substantial investment in a 10th Generation chip might mean the need to buy a new Rocket Lake chip when the time comes if you want to gain support for that new, faster bus. (It's mostly of interest now only to shoppers looking for bleeding edge speed from a PCI Express 4.0 M.2 SSD.) One additional important point of conversation in this tier (less so for processors like the Core i9-10900K), is the inclusion of the UHD Graphics 630 IGP silicon on the Core i5-10600K. Both Ryzen processors lack any form of IGP, which means you'll need to have a discrete video card factored into the cost of your build or upgrade. Some casual gamers at this level look for CPUs that can also carry their graphical workload, although we wouldn't recommend going that route for any longer than you have to. (Most UHD Graphics 630-reliant chips can't do more than 50 frames per second in games like Fortnite at 1080p, and that game will run on almost anything modern.) Note that Intel also offers processors in its 10th Generation line that end in ""F,"" which are slightly cheaper than their non-F equivalents but have the IGP disabled. If you know you'll only ever use your CPU with a discrete video card, you could opt for one of these F-chips and save a few bucks. But the savings isn't huge. Pricing is also a thorny issue between the i5-10600K, its lesser 10th Gen Core i5 kin, and the Ryzen 5 competition. We decided to list the current street prices for the two Ryzens rather than AMD's MSRP (list price) becauseâsurprise, surprise!âprices changed a bit right as the Intel chips launched. The cost of AMD's most competitive CPUs dropped across a wide range of online retailers we surveyed, in anticipation of the launch. The other reason our price distinction is important: The only pricing we have seen for the Core i5-10600K at this writing is in ""RCP Per 1K"" prices, provided by Intel, which only tells the story of how much the CPUs will cost if you order 1,000 or more units at onceâfar from a normal scenario for most users. Usually the ultimate figure is slightly higher than that for one-off buys by end users. It's expected that retailers will charge closer to $275 for the Core i5-10600K out the door, and if that holds, at current pricing that would make it at least 20 to 30 percent more expensive than its closest AMD equivalent, the six-core/12-thread Ryzen 5 3600X. (Possibly a lot more; we saw the $200 3600X price listed earlier at two mainstream etailers at this writing.) Again, that is not too surprising considering the huge leaps that AMD made alongside TSMC in bringing the cost per core of the latest ""Zen 2""-based Ryzens down to levels designed to make Intel sweat. We tested the Core i5-10600K on an Asus ROG Maximus XII Hero (Wi-Fi) motherboard, with 16GB of G.Skill memory clocked to 3,000MHz (for comparability with our earlier CPU reviews), and an Intel SATA boot SSD paired with an ADATA SATA M.2 secondary drive. All this was packed in ADATA's XPG Invader chassis, fitted with a Deepcool GamerStorm Captain 240 EX 240mm liquid cooler and a 750-watt Corsair power supply. For our gaming tests, we used an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, at Founders Edition clocks, as we have on all recent mainstream and high-end CPU reviews. Unlike most of Intel's mainstream CPU line, the Core i5-10600K is one of the few that does not bundle an Intel stock cooler in the box. We suspect a high-end air cooler or a liquid cooler for this chip and its 125-watt TDP is in order if you intend to tweak. Indeed, you'll have to splash out for something. (A 240mm cooler like we used in our tests will set you back at least $100 or so, unless you own one already.) That said, LGA 1200 works with coolers designed for other recent Intel mainstream chip sockets, such as LGA 1151 and LGA 1156. So you may be able to repurpose an Intel cooler you own. The lack of a boxed cooler here is in marked contrast to the various Ryzens on either side of it, which bundle one of AMD's serviceable Wraith air coolers right in the box, for some potential further savings. (In the current Ryzen line, only the top mainstream model, the much costlier Ryzen 9 3950X, comes cooler-less.) First, some performance preface. We noted some more ""teething"" with this prelaunch testing session than with most new-platform-launch CPU reviews. We suspect most of this wobble will clear with early BIOS updates; we can't help but think with the COVID-19 crisis and all of the disruption it has caused to commerce and business, that a smooth-as-glass launch could hardly be immune to at least a few hiccups.  We started our testing with a Gigabyte Z490 Aorus Master board provided by Intel with the chip samples, but we had difficulties getting the board to install Windows 10 on a couple of SATA SSDs; the install would fail, with the PC shutting down and rebooting partway through the Windows 10 setup process for reasons we were unable to diagnose. We ended up settling on the Asus ROG Maximus XII Hero board as our alternate tester. (We detailed the same issue in our review of the Core i9-10900K; we tried the Windows 10 install with each chip installed in turn, thinking that swapping out the chip might clear the issue, but we saw the same result with both i9 and i5 on that board.) Also note: The Asus board received a couple of BIOS updates in the course of our testing, one of them (version 0509) coming so close to the launch that we were able to install it just two days before the launch date and rerun our tests, invalidating all our earlier results. (It cleared up some thermal anomalies we noted in early tests, though.) Among the most widely used predictors of a CPU's relative performance are the Cinebench R15 and R20 benchmark tests, which offer a good muscle measure for demanding multi-threaded content-creation apps. These are thoroughly CPU-centric tests that gauge both the single-core performance and the multicore performance of a processor when it is stressed. The resulting scores are proprietary numbers that represent the CPU's capabilities while rendering a complex 3D image. Intel itself has been de-emphasizing Cinebench as a core benchmarking utility for the last few launches, but looking at these results, the tests don't cast the 10600K in a bad light. Right out of the gate, the Core i5-10600K scores are almost right in range with what's meant to be its direct competition, the Ryzen 3600X. But then, you have to remember the price difference between the two. Also worth noting: what the step-up eight-core/16-thread Ryzen 7 3700X was going for at this writing. (It was widely available for $289 to $329 from the big etailers.) Suddenly, our enthusiasm for the latest Ryzens makes a bit more sense? If you render graphics or work in the VFX field, AMD's answers will be the better value. One note in the CPU tests: Watch the scores of the Ryzen 5 3400G. This is an AMD ""APU,"" or CPU with onboard graphics. Remember our discussion about the UHD Graphics 630 IGP in the Core i5-10600K, and how the Ryzen 5 3600 and 3600X require a video card because they lack an IGP? The Ryzen 5 3400G is the closest equivalent AMD mainstream CPU with onboard IGP. (It uses older ""Zen+"" process tech, not Zen 2.) As you'll see, it is a lot weaker than the Core i5. (Mind you, it's also just $150, with four cores/eight threads, versus the 6/12 on the Core i5.) For another kind of real-world look at single-core performance, we use a very vintage version of Apple's iTunes to encode a series of music tracks. It remains in our test lineup simply as a representative of legacy software that we all use from time to time that has not been optimized for multicore operation. Intel won't take a loss lying down, and once again the company proves that even against more expensive AMD processors, the Core i5-10600K is the superior single-core engine of the bunch. (If that is what you are looking for.) The POV-Ray benchmark is a synthetic, highly threaded rendering test that offers a second opinion on the Cinebench results. This test uses ray tracing to render (offscreen) a three-dimensional image. (Note that it doesn't use the ray tracing features of Nvidia's RTX-class GPUs; this is purely CPU-focused.) We run all-cores and single-core variants. The all-cores run shows the Ryzen 5 below and the Ryzen 7 above both beating the Core i5-10600K, though the single-core results are again all Intel's. As an all-core rendering benchmark, the Handbrake test is a great indicator of how well a processor will handle tasks like video editing, video rendering, and video conversion. These kinds of apps tend to make good use of all the cores and threads they can grab... Handbrake tests shows the Intel Core i5-10600K keeping a regular pace with its AMD equivalents, but it yet again is shown up by the Ryzen 7 3700X at a percentage (the i5 taking 33 percent longer) out of sync with the modest price difference (the Ryzen 7 being about 20 percent more expensive) between the two chips. Two more cores and four more threads help the Ryzen 7 a lot in tests like these. Meanwhile, the shorter Blender test, as run with our test file, is mostly useful for highlighting the differences between low-end and high-end chips, and the similarities between chips within these two categories. Here the Core i5-10600K does manage to beat the Ryzen 5 series chips by a hair, but that hair is equally as thin between itself and the Ryzen 7 3700X. And here we have the 7-Zip file-compression benchmark, another thread-happy, CPU-intensive task... In this test, the Ryzen 5 3600, Ryzen 5 3600X, and the Core i5-10600K are effectively in a three-way dead heat...and then the Ryzen 7 3700X shows up and dominates any value-proposition argument that the Core i5-10600K might have started to make with this bench. Here's what we saw in our bank of gaming tests with our GeForce RTX 2080 Ti card running the show. This top-end consumer graphics card is the primary limiter of performance at 4K with all of the CPUs that we have laid out below, but at 1080p, the card gets out of the way a bit more and lets the CPU differences shine.  Given its strong single-core chops (Intel's last signature move left at 14nm), it's not a shock to see the Core i5-10600K lead the AMD field here at 1080p. As expected, at 4K with this card, it's all on the graphics card; the differences at that resolution are essentially margin-of-error meaningless across the board. The thing we found most interesting, though, is that this 10th Generation i5 at 1080p was essentially flat against the last two gens of mainstream Core i7s from Intel. That's a pretty good showing for a Core i5, and makes us wonder what the 10th Generation Core i7s can do. However, just as we saw with the Core i9-10900K, the Core i5-10600K struggles to justify its cost gap between AMD's price-equivalent options in a wider sense. For most folks, the moderate gaming frame-rate improvements won't be enough to warrant the price jump in relation to the tiers of monitor refresh rates on the market today. The differences in frame rates between the chips (with the RTX 2080 Ti we tested, anyway) aren't big enough to make a game-changing difference with say, a 144Hz gaming monitor versus a 240Hz one. The differences in frame rates might be more meaningful with a lesser video card, but even so, the price premium levied by the 10th Gen i5 and its required new platform and cooler cost cannot be ignored. That possible extra money spent could just as well be a down payment on a better video card. The real argument-changer, though, is the four-core/eight-thread Ryzen 3 3300X, at $120, released just before the Intel 10th Generation rollout. In a world where the Ryzen 3 3300X doesn't exist, the Core i5-10600K does almost enough to look like a good deal for mainstream gamers interested in high frame rates alone, with the bonus of high core/thread counts. But unfortunately for Intel, that's not the world we live in today. For the $100-plus price difference between the Ryzen 3 3300X and the Core i5-10600K, you can likely step up your video card a fair bit, if you're buying a new one alongside that new CPU. Plus, if you happen to already own an AMD AM4-socket motherboard, you might save on that, too. You definitely need a new board to work with the Core i5-10600K, because compatible LGA 1200 ones didn't exist until now. And, as we mentioned, maybe you need to buy a cooler, too. We didn't have enough time post-BIOS updates before launch to dig really deep into overclocking the Core i5-10600K manually within the BIOS. We ran into issues getting Intel's in-Windows XTU utility to show much improvement beyond modest overclocks, and we found the only gains came by tweaking the power-limit (PL) states in XTU to keep the chip from power-limiting partway into test runs. We suspect a few days of concerted overclocking directly in the Asus BIOS would yield better gains than we got. That said, we didn't see the Core i5-10600K exceed temperatures of 85 degrees C our limited hands-on OC trials, a win that could likely be chalked up to Intel's move to sand down the layers that sit between the die of the chip and your CPU cooler. Our stock run of Cinebench R20 saw the chip peak at 77 degrees C. Bear in mind, again, that we used a 240mm liquid cooler that cost about $129. At $275 plus $129, you could get close to a Ryzen 9 3900X and its decent stock air cooler for the combined cost, and you would not have to overclock it. For the sake of time (and a bit of sanity) during this launch, we went with Asus' AI-based overclocking feature, an auto-OC tool built into our test board to see what the machine could do on its own. That did break through some of the XTU logjams we were seeing and did get our all-cores Cinebench R20 test to bounce up by about 5 percent on a couple of runs, and our Handbrake test's render time to fall by about the same 5 percent measure. However, gaming and 7-Zip results remained essentially flat. Given that much of the Core i5-10600K's selling point over the Core i5-10600 ""non-K"" is its overclocking options, if you're dead-set on grabbing an Intel CPU in this price bracket and don't care about getting into the tweak zone, the $213 (suggested RCP, remember) price of the Core i5-10600 makes more sense than the $262 RCP of the Core i5-10600K. Again, though, bear in mind that the cheaper non-K chip features a much lower (3.3GHz) base clock. But it does bundle a cooler! If we make more progress on overclock after launch we'll update this space, but even so: Even if we were able to boost the various CPU benches by as much as 10 percent, it wouldn't radically change the value calculus, to our eyes, for multithreaded tasks, given that Ryzen 7 3700X, with a bundled cooler, lurking right around the price corner. Relying on 14nm for one more go-around is keeping Intel in the race, but with this Core i5, it's huffing. The time for a drink of new process tech is clear. We'll repeat (in spirit) a point we made in our Core i9-10900K review, but with different pricing dynamics. The Intel Core i5-10600K is likely going to debut at somewhere around $275 to $300 once it's on shelves, making it more than twice as expensive as the Ryzen 3 3300X, while performing an average of only 11 percent faster in gaming tests and making you BYOC (Bring Your Own Cooler), to boot. As a midrange processor that hangs tight with AMD's midrange offerings on performance but gets spanked on price (both for the chip and the platform upgrade), the Core i5-10600K increasingly looks a bit too pricey for today's CPU climate. With Ryzen, the CPU world has changed, but Intel's pricing structure hasn't. Only the re-addition of Hyper-Threading to most of the line here with the 10th generation chips keeps things reasonable. And if you must have an IGP on your CPU, as opposed to using this chip with a video card, the Core i5-10600K outpaces the current Ryzen 5 combined CPU/GPU solution, the Ryzen 5 3400G, decisively. (Of course, at more than $100 costlier, going for the Core i5 will cost you enough extra to buy a modest video card.) If you'll excuse us for a minor existential moment, let's pull back to talk about what processors are made for: helping you do what you want to do as fast as they possibly can. Intel's Core i5-10600K does offer slightly faster gaming results flat out, but its higher per-core cost makes it a bit less appealing to users also trying to gain the most content creation muscle for the money. AMD simply does that balance better as we head into the second half of 2020. You should never have to choose what your processor does ""best""; it should just do it all. AMD proves that its 7nm-based Zen 2 processors are consistently the better value in multi-thread-heavy content crunching (especially when the new, cheaper Ryzen 7 3700X comes into the mix), while remaining competitive enough with Intel on gaming in light of the performance-per-dollar ratio. AMD definitely doesn't outright win on frames per second, but that loss can be mitigated by many buyers in the reduced price (for cooling, platform upgrades, and cost per core), increased multicore performance, and also, well...the potential GPU power you can buy with the money you save. At this writing, we didn't see the Core i5-10600K processor available from any U.S. etailers yet. Intel doesn't set these sellers' prices outright, so maybe the market will do its work quickly and bring the 10600K down a Jackson or two from the 1,000-unit price. We weren't able to find any online retailers who were carrying this chip the week of its launch, though Intel's official line is that the processors will make their way onto shelves as stock becomes available. This may be down to COVID-19, so that is no ding at Intel, by any means. But regardless of when it hits retailers, the fact remains that AMD is producing same-core-count processors for close to, if not less than, Intel on every front. And in some cases, its next-tier-up chips are starting to impinge on Intel ones in the tier below. (To wit, the pricing we are seeing on the Ryzen 7 3700X versus what this i5 will likely go for.) Intel has some work to do before it's back in this race at full tilt. While the Core i5-10600K's gaming numbers look fine in a vacuum, the added cost of the Core i5-10600K and a cooler over the Ryzen 5 3600 or 3600X could be spent on your GPU. Which means the AMD system that gets built with the same amount of money you'd spend on an Intel equivalent, if you choose the components wisely, will be pound for pound more powerful. Full stop.

intel-i5-10600K,tomshardware,"And Intel's Core i5 series could definitely use some help -- the third-gen Ryzen processors, for all of their headline-stealing high core counts in the higher-end models, did the most damage in Intel's mid-range due to their superior value and ultra-competitive gaming performance. The Core i5 and Ryzen 5 segments comprise the bulk of sales to the ever-growing cadre of gamers and enthusiasts looking for the best bang for the buck, so success here is key.  The Core i5-10600K's combination of a higher thread count at similar pricing to the previous-gen, high stock clock frequencies, palatable power consumption, and agile overclockability cooks up a winner for the gaming and enthusiast crowds. Intel even reduced the gap in threaded workloads like productivity tasks. For gamers looking for the edge of performance and enthusiasts who like to tune their processors without hideously-priced supporting components, the Core i5-10600K slots in as the new mainstream champ.  Intel re-aligned its Core i5 series, which came with six cores and threads with the previous-gen chips, to six cores with 12 threads for the Comet Lake models. That comes by simply enabling Hyper-Threading, but it boosts the Core i5-10600K's thread count beyond that of the previous-gen eight-core/thread i7-9700K, setting the stage for impressive performance improvements.  And the new chip didn't disappoint. Our testing found that the 10600K still trails the 9700K in application performance, but it's close enough in gaming to call it a wash. That's a huge step forward on the value front. Pricing is competitive, too, especially with the $25 discount for picking the graphics-less 10600KF model. If you're not interested in buying a discrete graphics card, the 10600K's UHD Graphics 630 engine remains the same compared to the prior gen, right down to the clock rates. That gives Intel a leg up over AMD, which doesn't offer integrated graphics in this price range. Just don't expect to do any meaningful gaming on the Intel chip without a dedicated graphics card. The six-core, twelve thread Core i5-10600K ticks at a 4.1 GHz and 4.8 GHz boost, and unlike the Core i9 models, Intel doesn't include it's complicated matrix of TurboBoost 3.0 Max and Thermal Velocity Boost (TVB) clock rates, making this a simple case of what you see is what you get.  As you can see in the table above, Intel has steadily bumped up its multi-core clock rates with each new generation of chips, with the 10600K marking yet another jump over the previous-gen Core i5 chips. The 10600K still trails the Core i7-9700K's single- and all-core boosts, but offsets it with a much higher 4.1 GHz base (and accompanying TDP rating). That means the 10600K won't entirely match the previous-gen i7 in all applications, but our testing shows it comes close.  The 10600K comes with a 125W TDP rating, a new high for Intel's Core i5 series as the company turned up the power dial on its base clock rates from 3.7 GHz with the previous-gen Core i5-9600K to 4.1 GHz. Still, it's important to remember the TDP rating doesn't have a one-to-one relation to power consumption, and it only applies to stock settings at the base frequency (PL1). Intel recommends a maximum of 220W at PL2 (peak power consumption during boost), but as always, motherboard vendors are free to ignore those recommendations, so board selection is important.  The 10600K comes with 12MB of L3 cache, an increase of 3MB over the Core i5-9600K. Intel increased memory support up to DDR4-2933, which lags AMD's DDR4-3200 memory transfer rates. Like the chip's other ratio multipliers, Intel fully enables memory overclocking on Z-series motherboards, but you'll lose that functionality on the B- and H-series. Be sure to price in a Z-series board and a cooling solution, preferably liquid, if you're off to the overclocking races. Meanwhile, AMD allows overclocking on all but its A-Series motherboards. "
intel-i5-11600K,pcmag,"The six-core/12-thread Core i5-11600K ($262) shuttles a bit of stability into the launch of Intel's 11th Generation (""Rocket Lake"") line of newly launched desktop CPUs. The first sign of Rocket Lake launch wobble was the premature sales by a reseller, and subsequent early testing, of the Core i7-11700K chip a few weeks back. Then there's the Core i9; we're still in the depths of solving some issues with our testing of the company's flagship Intel Core i9-11900K. The Core i5-11600K has proved a sturdier look into what we can hope to expect out of Intel's line of upcoming CPUs.  Single-core performance, as ever, remains an Intel strength. The Core i5-11600K scored impressively in many single-core runs that had favored AMD's $299 six-core/12-thread Ryzen 5 5600X to this point, and it also makes a case for itself against the previous-generation Intel Core i5-10600K. The gaming results were a bit back-and-forth against the competition, and the required platform upgrade (to the LGA 1200 socket) might be too pricey an entry burden for some midrange-component shoppers. But for the Intel faithful looking for a solid chip to use with a video card to PC-game on a budget, the Core i5-11600K is a strapping entry into a slightly crowded, but constantly evolving, segment of the market. To start off, if you'd prefer a deeper dive into all the 11th Generation goodness we've got to spare (including info on motherboard compatibility and cost of adoption), head on over to our review of the Intel Core i9-11900K flagship chip to get all the details. For starters, though, here's how the various chips in the Rocket Lake lineup shake out. (Note that for legibility's sake we've left out the low-power 35-watt ""T"" versions of these chips, which will be of interest mostly to OEMs.) For the sake of this review, let's keep things simple and focus in on the Intel Core i5-11600K's placement in the stack against similar Intel processors, as well as what the competition is up to over at AMD... The six-core/12-thread Intel Core i5-11600K represents the pillar of Intel's midrange options, and finds itself competing across the aisle with processors like AMD's Ryzen 5 5600X ($299), the Ryzen 5 3600X ($249), the Ryzen 3 3300X ($120) in gaming, specifically. For the first time in what feels like forever, though, Intel is now sniping down AMD's pricing, rather than things being the other way around. AMD, with its XT chips of the Ryzen 3000 Series and the newer chips in the Ryzen 5000 Series, has let its pricing rise a bit relative to earlier generations of Ryzen. The Ryzen 5 5600X retails for $299 (whether or not you'll find one at that price is another matter), and even though Intel hasn't changed its pricing model since the $262 i5-10600K was launched last year, AMD's price creep of $50 is the key to Intel's edge this time around. Over on Intel's aisle, you can see there aren't any ground-shattering changes or improvements on offer here compared with the company's own previous-generation six-core/12-thread Core i5-10600K ($262), with just a 100MHz difference separating the two on max boost clock. (Again, our Intel Core i9-11900K review will give you a better perspective on how exactly Intel calculates what those clocks really mean for performance.) Like many of the other chips in the Intel 11th Generation stack, the Core i5-11600K includes a new Intel UHD Graphics 750 integrated graphics processor (IGP). Intel has some surprisingly stiff competition in this regard, even though AMD doesn't yet have any processors with an IGP plus more than four cores onboard in its 3000 or 5000 Ryzen lines. For the sake of comparison, the closest model we can point to in Ryzen is the four-core/eight-thread AMD Ryzen 5 3400G with its Vega 11 onboard graphics, but don't let that lower core count fool youâthe 3400G has time and time again proven itself a formidable APU foe. Finally, Intel has no plans to include a bundled cooler with its Core i5-11600K. This is a miss in our books. As both a CPU with IGP and a midrange option that could provide a baseline for upgrades later down the line, the Core i5-11600K would be, in our opinion, better served by bundling a cooler. The lack of one is down to this being one of Intel's unlocked ""K"" chips; the expectation is that the overclockers who buy K-models will want to bring their own cooler. The non-K Core i5 chips in the line, such as the Core i5-11500 and Core i5-11400 detailed above, have slightly lower clocks but will bundle an Intel stock cooler. They get you the same six cores and integrated graphics, and may well be a better value if you're not the overclocking type. We tested the Core i5-11600K on an Asus ROG Maximus XIII Hero (Wi-Fi) Z590 motherboard, with 16GB of G.Skill memory clocked to 3,000MHz (for comparability with our earlier CPU reviews), and a Mushkin Pilot-E PCI Express 3.0 boot SSD paired with a Samsung SSD 860 QVO SATA secondary drive. All this was packed in ADATA's XPG Invader chassis, fitted with a Deepcool GamerStorm Captain 240 EX 240mm liquid cooler, and an MSI 850-watt MPG A850GF power supply. For our gaming tests, we used an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, at Founders Edition clocks, as we have on all recent mainstream and high-end CPU reviews. We test CPUs using a variety of synthetic benchmarks that offer proprietary scores, as well as real-world tests using consumer apps like 7-Zip, and 3D games such as Far Cry 5. For chips at the tier of the Intel Core i5-11600K, we also run several games using the IGP alone, without a discrete video card. Included in the charts below is a variety of like-priced competing and sibling AMD and Intel CPUs. Over the last couple of years, Intel's midrange options have struggled against AMD's in productivity tasks. That's because with the 9th Generation Core line, Intel nixed thread-doubling Hyper-Threading below the Core i9 level. It restored it with 10th Generation and it's here again with 11th Gen Rocket Lake. So how did the Core i5-11600K, with its Hyper-Threading retained, fare once all its threads were put to the test? Unfortunately, there's just too much that the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X does well for the Intel Core i5-11600K to seize any crowns here, though the performance is certainly solid for the price if the 5600X is sold out (and at this rate, who are we kidding, it probably will be at any given time). There are certain benchmark runs detailed here, such as Cinebench, where the Intel Core i5-11600K states a strong case for its value proposition against AMD, being the cheaper chip. But then we move to outright core-eaters like the 7-Zip benchmark, and we see a drop of nearly 30% in performance versus the 12% gap in price. Our Handbrake run was just 26 seconds off from the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X, though the Intel Core i5-10600K looks to have them both beat by a hair, keeping itself in the race as a still-viable option for value hunters who don't mind staying back a generation to save. Our pure single-threaded task of converting songs in iTunes gives the Core i5-11600K a true chance to stretch its Turbo-powered legs, just clearing Intel's claims of ""19% gen-over-gen IPC gains,"" with 20% faster results than the Core i5-10600K. Here's what we saw in our bank of gaming tests with our GeForce RTX 2080 Ti card running the show. This top-end consumer graphics card is the primary arbiter of performance at 4K with all of the CPUs that we have laid out below. At 1080p, though, the card gets out of the way a bit more and lets the CPU differences shine.  In this run of tests, the Core i5-11600K is competitive with AMD, but it still loses out in most head-to-head battles against the Ryzen 5 5600X. The Intel Core i5-11600K scores close enough to the Ryzen 7 5800X to warrant a double-take in some of our older-game runs (what we call our ""legacy game tests""), and in AAA titles like Far Cry 5, the Core i5-11600K comes within a close enough distance to the Ryzen 5 5600X to turn the price-to-performance ratio in its favor. This is the first Intel processor to have actually stayed competitive with AMD on price in a while, though admittedly that's more a product of AMD's price creep with its Ryzen 5000 chips than any engineering achievement or efficiencies on behalf of Intel. However, as always with these things, a bit of context is in order. For example, does the 11600K win flat out in Rainbow Six: Siege? Nope, that honor goes to the Ryzen 7 5800X with 421fps...but that's still 61fps faster than the fastest monitor on shelves today, while the Core i5-11600K is just 16 frames per second shy of hitting that golden 360Hz future-proof spec. In other words, a handful of frames either way may not make a difference if your display can't show them. So you'll want to be cognizant of the capabilities of your gaming monitor and its refresh rate before obsessing over a handful of frames one way or the other. As a midrange chip, the Intel Core i5-11600K straddles the line as a chip that can power games along with a discrete GPU, as well as a chip that can run the show all on its own with the help of its onboard Iris Xe-based UHD Graphics 750 silicon. We run lower-end CPUs that have IGPs through a series of games tuned to either near-lowest, or the lowest, settings at a 1,280-by-720-pixel resolution (720p), as well as at 1,920 by 1,080 pixels (1080p). Here is what we saw with this lot... Pretty good for Intel integrated graphics; as you can see, the Intel UHD Graphics 630 can't even carry the UHD 750's coat. There's definitely a clear uplift in performance when comparing the previous generation of Intel UHD 630 Graphics options. However, the AMD Ryzen 5 3400G proves once again to be one of the best CPUs with an IGP in the business for budget-minded gamers, regularly beating out the Core i5-11600K by no small margin. Even the lesser Radeon Vega graphics on the Ryzen 3 3200G (in theory, a $99 CPU, if you can find one these days at that price) topped the UHD 750 in the Core i5-11600K. This shows some great strides for Intel integrated graphics, but AMD's G 3000 Series chips still have it beat for tight-budget gamers looking for CPU and GPU power in a single chip. And rumor has it that new 5000 Series Ryzen G chips are coming in the first half of this year. Look out. The Intel Core i5-11600K never topped 86 degrees C in our stress testing; however, that figure could be down to the overkill 240mm AIO liquid cooling system used in our testbed. The Intel Core i5-11600K rests right on the line of where a larger air cooler or a smaller liquid loop could achieve similar results, so ultimately which you go with will be more about the available space in your case (and your budget) than the amount of cooling power you can expect the i5-11600K to benefit from. As the midrange option for Intel's overclocker crowd, we set out to get a substantial boost out of our Intel Core i5-11600K, only to be met with disappointment when most of our attempts to get it off the clock-speed ground level resulted in bluescreen after bluescreen. As mentioned above, we've been noticing some stability issues with our latest BIOS build in our Asus Z590 testbed. (Our review of the Core i9-11900K has more detail on all that.) But stay tuned as we continue to work with Asus to try and find a solution to these problems hopefully in the near future. As Intel's most current performance-minded midrange option to hit shelves, the Core i5-11600K is a dutiful, if a bit stodgy, entry into the marketplace. Given the choice between it and the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X, even with the price difference in Intel's favor it's still AMD's game. But Intel has at least found a way to stay in play. Our testing of the Intel Core i5-11600K wasn't stalled by any of the same issues we ran into while trying to get the Intel Core i9-11900K running at spec, which is a plus no matter how you slice it. The chip ran considerably cooler than the aforementioned Core i9, and it never showed an ounce of the stability issues in the course of our standard testing, only slipping up once we tried to apply some aftermarket overclocks on a platform that doesn't seem to respond well to them just yet. The ""K"" part of this chip remains dormant so far, at least for us. We expect that to change as BIOSes do. If you've been waiting to upgrade an older-generation Intel midrange CPU, the Core i5-11600K should be a consideration, especially if you are one of the Intel faithful who wants a light-gaming system on a chip that beats out venerable UHD Graphics 630 implementations. But for that specific usage case, AMD's Ryzen 5 3400G again swoops in to prove itself as the superior IGP-based gaming option, placing the Intel Core i5-11600K squarely back in a role that's grown all too familiar for Intel of late: a very workable solution, but trailing in AMD's digital dust. The midrange Core i5-11600K is a six-core, 11th Generation CPU just fast enough to keep Intel's new ""Rocket Lake"" chips in the game against tough AMD opposition.

intel-i5-11600K,tomshardware,"The lowered core count is an unavoidable side effect of Intel basing its new architecture on a design that originally debuted with its 10nm Ice Lake processors, but the decision to etch it onto the 14nm process left its chip designers with a leaner transistor density budget that ultimately resulted in fewer cores. Meanwhile, the six-core twelve thread Core i5-11600K lands with a much friendlier $262 price point that's much more competitive with AMD's comparable chips. In light of its price point, it has a very competitive price-to-performance ratio with the $300 Ryzen 5 5600X in a broad swath of games and applications. While the Core i5-11600K might not claim absolute supremacy, its mixture of price and performance makes it a solid buy. Provided, of course, that you can find any of these chips at close to sane pricing.  Intel's chip frequencies have become a confusing array of four different flavors of Turbo Boost, many with both single- and multi-core ratios, that differ based on each family of chips. We've narrowed these listings down to the peak boost frequencies in the table below, with each indicating the peak boosting tech used. We've also narrowed down the list of chips to the most important models. We'll circle back with a complete list of chips, specs, and boost definitions on the following page. As we've seen for several chip generations, Intel also offers graphics-less F-series models that have the same specs as their full-featured counterparts but come at a lower price point. Keep those in mind if you don't need integrated graphics.

The eight-core Core i9-11900K slots in as the flagship model for the Rocket Lake family. Fast clock speeds are a clear attraction, but they come at the expense of power â two of the chip's cores boost to a peak of 5.3 GHz, and all cores can operate at 4.8 GHz simultaneously. The 11900K has a 125W PL1 power rating (at the base frequency) and a 250W PL2 (boost) rating, both of which are identical to the previous-gen 10900K despite having two fewer cores.  The Core i9 K and KF models are Intel's first chips to come with Adaptive Boost Technology (ABT), which allows the processors to dynamically boost to higher all-core frequencies based upon available thermal headroom and electrical conditions (a bit more detail below). This new tech will feel decidedly familiar to AMD fans, as it operates in a very similar fashion to AMD's existing boost mechanism that's present in newer Ryzen processors.  The eight-core 16-thread flagship Core i9-11900K comes with a suggested $539 price tag, a $51 markup over the previous-gen ten-core 10900K. The 11900K slots in for $10 less than the Ryzen 9 5900X, which means we're looking at an eight-core chip taking on a 12-core 24-thread chip that will easily beat it in threaded workloads. Intel's obvious goal here is to beat the 5900X at gaming so it can justify the price tag. Notably, Intel's non-K Core i9 and i7 models carry the same pricing as their prior-gen counterparts. As per usual, K SKUs come without coolers, and you'll need a capable cooler to unlock the best of Rocket Lake. The Core i5-11600K contends directly with the $299 Ryzen 5 5600X in the heart of the mainstream gaming market, so this is an exceptionally important model. The $262 six-core Core i5-11600K matches the pricing of the previous-gen i5-10600K. The 11600K boosts to a peak of 4.9 GHz on two cores and can maintain a 4.6 GHz all-core frequency.  The 11600K comes with a 125W PL1 rating, the same as the previous-gen 10600K, but has a 251W PL2, a whopping 69W increase compared to the previous 182W limit. The Core i5-11400 also stands out as a potentially great deal, with $182 (or $157 for the F-series part) being a solid price for a six-core 12-thread processor. We have this processor inbound for review. Intel has stepped forward from DDR4-2933 to DDR4-3200, but the company also introduced a new paradigm with Rocket Lake: Only the Core i9 chips support DDR4-3200 in an optimal configuration at stock settings. This setting is called 'Gear 1,' and signifies that the memory controller and memory operate at the same frequency (1:1), thus providing the lowest latency and best performance in lightly-threaded work, like gaming.   All other Rocket Lake chips only officially support DDR4-3200 with the 'Gear 2' setting, which allows the memory to operate at twice the frequency of the memory controller (2:1) and results in higher data transfer rates, which can benefit some threaded workloads but also results in higher latency that can lead to reduced performance in some applications. Intel justifies the new segmentation approach because memory controllers fall into the binning equation, meaning chips with slower controllers are only rated for DDR4-3200 in Gear 2 mode. The official top speed for the Gear 1 setting is DDR4-2933 for all Core i7 and i5 chips, and running DDR4-3200 in lower-latency Gear 1 mode is considered overclocking. Intel isn't known for harsh memory overclocking restrictions when processing returns, but running memory beyond the spec does technically void your warranty. Intel has confirmed that all Rocket Lake-S chips come with the same eight-core die, with two cores disabled for the six-core models. Surprisingly, based on our rough projections, Rocket Lake's eight-core die is about 34% larger than the ten-core Comet Lake die.

In an odd twist, this could be a good development for enthusiasts because it should help make the chips easier to cool compared to the previous-gen models â the 11900K has the same peak power specifications and 34% more silicon area from which to dissipate the thermal load. That should bode well for the six core models, too, which have more inactive silicon to help absorb heat from neighboring cores. However, Intel has obviously decided to consume the extra thermal headroom by increasing the 11600K's power limit under heavy load by 69 watts.  Intel chalks much of the die size disparity up to GPU and CPU cores that are physically larger than those found on Comet Lake, a byproduct of backporting from 10nm to 14nm, along with the increased number of graphics EUs. Intel could have shrunk or removed the integrated graphics engine to cram in more CPU cores within its power, performance, area, and cost (PPAC) targets, but integrated graphics are a key requirement for the high-volume OEM systems market that tends to leverage on-chip graphics rather than discrete GPUs. As a result, Intel says it chose this balance of units to meet its design goals across the broader desktop PC market. Intel's 14nm process is ultra-mature, so we assume yields are superb, and also that the majority of its chipmaking equipment is depreciated, meaning it should be relatively cost-effective to punch out a flood of Rocket Lake chips while AMD remains supply constrained. However, fabbing a larger die exposes the chips to a greater chance of defects, thus complicating the binning process, potentially reducing yield, and resulting in fewer die per wafer. All of these factors conspire to increase manufacturing costs, which could help explain Intel's higher pricing for its highest-binned SKUs."
intel-i5-12400F,pcmag,"""Alder Lake,"" Intel's 12th Generation family of CPUs, has three primary members at launch: the two go-go-performance parents (the Core i9-12900K and Core i7-12700K), alongside junior (the Core i5-12600K). Well, that kid is precocious: Intel's new Core i5-12600K ($289) desktop CPU may bring up the rear of the company's first set of 12th Gen chips, but it posts some impressive gains over its predecessors in Intel's line. The Core i5-12600K finds itself sandwiched within a series of near-impeccable midrange CPU launches from AMD over the past year, but there's no denying the Core i5-12600K's prowess on display here. It comes within spitting distance of matching the content-creation results of older, former mega-core monsters like the $989 Intel Core i9-10980XE Extreme Edition and the $499 AMD Ryzen 9 3900X. It even manages to beat the 10-core, $449 Core i9-10900K in some of the same tests. That said, its integrated graphics performance is still dwarfed by the similarly threaded, Editors' Choice-winning Ryzen 7 5700G and six-core Ryzen 5 5600G, which provide a much stronger value proposition to gamers looking to build their next rig around a system-on-a-chip (SoC), without a graphics card. If you want serious content creation power out of a chip class that's historically been known for midrange gaming, the Core i5-12600K is certainly equipped for the job. Just be ready to pay a pretty penny to get yours off the ground, thanks to the new (and pricey) Z690 motherboard platform taking tickets at the door. Based off Intel's new ""7 Process,"" the company's 12th Generation desktop CPUs are built on 10nm lithography and employ a new motherboard socket (LGA 1700), finally breaking the company out of its half-decade love/hate affair with the 14nm process and its iterations that followed for years after. You can read more about how Intel defines its ""7 Process"" in-depth at ExtremeTech. You'll notice in the spec chart below some new CPU-core types being thrown around, stuff like ""P-cores"" and ""E-cores."" To find out everything you need to know about those terms and more, check out our full breakdown of Intel's Performance Hybrid Architecture in our in-depth review of the Intel Core i9-12900K, essential reading for understanding what is new in Alder Lake. We won't repeat all that detail here. Though the Ryzen 5 5600X, at first, seems like the obvious AMD foil for a direct comparison to the Intel Core i5-12600K, in practice the Core i5-12600KF would be a more fitting opponent, since neither it nor the AMD chip has on-CPU graphics. (Intel is offering ""KF"" versions of its initial Core i9, i7, and i5 Alder Lake chips, making six total chips at launch.) Instead of focusing on that chip, then, we'll turn our attention to how the Intel Core i5-12600K stacks up against two of the best moderate-priced Ryzen chips we've tested yetâand the ones AMD most recently released in the desktop gaming spaceâthe Ryzen 5 5600G and the Ryzen 7 5700G. These two flank the Core i5-12600K on price, at $239 and $329, respectively. (Those are current street prices; the list prices are $259.99 and $359.99.) And both have integrated AMD Radeon RX Vega integrated graphics that, as we'll show in more detail below, are often capable of standing in for a discrete graphics card when the moment calls. With that brief intro out of the way, let's jump into some specs... As a 12th Gen Intel Core processor, the Core i5-12600K is just like the rest of its Alder Lake kin, bearing two different core types on board: in this case, six performance cores (those ""P-cores"" we mentioned earlier), and four ""E-cores,"" with the ""E"" short for efficiency. These add up to a maximum concurrent-processing-thread count of 16, with only the P-cores getting the two-threads-per-core Hyper-Threading support this time around. On cost, the Intel Core i5-12600K doesn't break any major barriers as far as price creep up the stack is concerned, and it remains slotted right between several members of AMD's Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 chip family, squarely in the midrange. The Intel Core i5-12600K comes with the same integrated graphics as the rest of the ""K""-series CPUs in the 12th Genâthe company's new Iris Xe UHD Graphics 770 siliconâthough ""new"" is a bit disingenuous. The main changes from UHD Graphics 750 are a slightly reduced base clock speed (300MHz, down from 350MHz), and an increased peak dynamic frequency (up to 1.55GHz, from 1GHz). So now that we know what's under the hood of Intel's latest midrange offering, how did it do in testing? Let's jump into the results and see what surprises Intel has in store... We tested the Core i5-12600K on an MSI MPG Z690 Carbon WiFi motherboard, with 32GB of DDR5 Corsair Dominator memory clocked to 4,800MHz, and a 4TB Sabrent Rocket Q4 PCI Express 4.0 boot SSD that also functioned as our game drive. All this was packed in Corsair's iCue 7000D Airflow chassis, fitted with a Corsair iCue H150i Elite Capellix 360mm liquid cooler, and a Corsair 1,000-watt RM1000X power supply. For our gaming tests, we used an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti, at Founders Edition clocks, as we have on all recent mainstream and high-end CPU reviews. We test CPUs using a variety of synthetic benchmarks that offer proprietary scores, as well as real-world tests using consumer apps such as 7-Zip, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Premiere (the Adobe apps being tested with workloads via workstation maker Puget Systems' PugetBench extensions). We also test with multiplayer games like Rainbow Six Siege, and AAA 3D games such as Assassin's Creed Valhalla. First up, CPU tests. These were run on a variety of Windows 10 testbeds that were built fresh for the advent of 12th Generation. We benchmarked all of our listed AMD processors as well as the back-tested Intel ones on Windows 10; due to time constraints, we didn't get to Windows 11 yet, with some additional testing to come on Win 11 for the Alder Lake chips. (The Windows 11 testing will be to bring Intel's Thread Director into play. For more on why that matters, again check out our Core i9-12900K review.) One note here: Since Intel has the platform handicap with the advent of Z690, we tested our AMD Ryzen 9 5950X, AMD's top-end mainstream Ryzen, on the most tricked-out, liquid-cooled system we had on hand, the Maingear Turbo (2021). While graphics tests won't be directly comparable (the RTX 3080 Ti we use, and the RTX 3090 in the Maingear, are a few percentage points apart in most games), the productivity tests of the Maingear, combined with its overkill liquid cooling, should bring a bit more parity between AMD's 16-core Core i9 chip and Intel's latest 16-core offering. But that is just for context, and a sideshow to the Core i5 we are discussing here. Well that is certainly a surprise, to say the least! Again: Bear in mind that these are mostly Windows 10 results. Even without Thread Director calling action from behind the scenes, Intel's latest midrange processor still posted a consistently impressive showing across almost every benchmark we ran. The exception, 7-Zip, acts as a more straightforward representation of the cores' power on their own, while considerable wins in both our Adobe runs with Photoshop and Premiere showcase what a little tuning can do to elevate the Core i5-12600K to some impressive heights. Also, remember: This is a Core i5 chip! Compare it to the Core i9-11900K. The Core i9-11900K wasn't a match for the Core i5-12600K in some of the tests, like Blender and the Adobe Photoshop/Premiere tests, though the 11900K's reduced core count compared to the i9-10900K (eight cores versus 10) already keep it at a content-creation disadvantage versus other recent Core i9s. Two tests that did seem to challenge the chip were POV-Ray and HandBrake. Here both the 12th Gen i5 and i9 limped to the finish line, a problem that will warrant future testing to suss out completely, given the otherwise strong showing in the rest of our benchmarks, especially the real-world Adobe ones. Here's what we saw in our bank of gaming tests with our GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Founders Edition card running the show, under Windows 10. This top-end consumer graphics card is the primary arbiter of performance at 4K with all of the CPUs that we have laid out below. At 1080p, though, the card gets out of the way a bit more and lets the CPU differences shine. (We test with 3DMark Time Spy and three games.) Predictably, the same problem we encountered during our review of the Core i9-12900K reared its head during our games testing of the i5-12600K: Assassin's Creed: Valhalla is unlaunchable on 12th Gen Intel Core chips. As we explained in that review, this is an issue that could be wider than just that, among many titles that use Denuvo DRM, or isolated to just a few. (Intel acknowledged such a thing in our briefings, more about which in the Core i9 review.) We didn't have time to test out any others on this Denuvo list, but as with overall Thread Director testing, we'll be digging deeper over the coming weeks into what the Intel Core 12th Gen stack can (or can't) play in late 2021. In a nutshell: With this issue, Denuvo confuses Alder Lake's two core types for two separate machines, triggering the DRM and crashing the game. Again, much more on that issue in our Core i9-12900K review. [Editor's Note: Intel has released a statement regarding Denuvo functionality on Intel 12th Gen processors. Workarounds are coming, but no determinate figure on when just yet.) The chip recovered a bit with some pace-setting frame rates on Rainbow Six Siege, though at 1080p it's also blowing well past the fastest refresh rates on monitors today. So if you wanted to step down to something like the Ryzen 5 5600G, in this instance it could be the better choice. And speaking of Ryzen 5000G Series chips being the better choice... As a midrange CPU with integrated graphics processing (IGP) on the chip proper, the Intel Core i5-12600K sits on the high end (of the midrange, stick with us) of CPUs that gamers might consider if they're going to build a new gaming system without a discrete graphics card. In today's GPU-starved market, having an IGP that can dutifully stand in for a video card in a pinch is a big selling point. It could make or break the purchase in many gamers' minds. So, with that, how did the company's UHD Graphics 770 (Iris Xe Graphics) fare? Let's find out. Note: These multiplayer results are a combination of our recent testing piece Can You Game Without a Graphics Card? We Tested 11 Desktop CPUs to Find Out in comparable games, along with the most recent results collected from the Intel Core i5-12600K during our testing for this review. Also note: ""WNR"" means ""would not run."" Despite refreshing the onboard graphics of both its latest 12th Gen stack (UHD Graphics 770), as well as 11th Gen (UHD Graphics 750) earlier this year, Intel's IGP platform still can't hold a candle to AMD's aging Radeon RX Vega IGPs. The results are so skewed in favor of AMD and chips like the Ryzen 7 5700G that the value proposition of the Intel Core i5-12600K as a viable SoC for PC gaming without a video card just isn't there. In normal graphics-card stock conditions, we wouldn't hold Intel's feet so close to the fire on this. But this is 2021, in which GPUs are hyper-inflated in price. And given that AMD has Ryzen G-Series CPUs that can clearly stand in for a low-end GPU, all on their own, the value proposition of the i5-12600K takes an inevitable hit if you want to do casual PC gaming off an IGP. That, and the sheer volume of would-not-runs (WNRs) we hit during IGP testing of the i5. Intel's latest graphics drivers provided to us for the Intel Core i5-12600K review were seemingly not quite there yet. We did manage to get a couple runs in F1 2021 to complete, but the full suite is still dominated by AMD's numbers due to so many disqualifications on Intel's end. We'll update this story if a more reliable driver set is released in the next several weeks. A quick note: Due to the increased complexity that's been added to the Z690 platform for overclockers, we'll be publishing a separate article soon that takes a deeper dive into everything that's on offer. In the meantime, for the sake of this review, we chose to run with Intel's latest version of its Extreme Tuning Utility (XTU) and its simple sliders to see what we could get done on a time budget. In those runs on the Core i5-12600K, we were able to achieve a ""good enough for a one-touch slider"" result of just under 10% over boost clock, which translated to around 6% more performance in F1 2021 and the Adobe Photoshop/PugetBench for Photoshop test run. Last up, we tried to push the Intel Core i5-12600K to its thermal limits in a 10-minute run through Cinebench R23 in CoreTemp. We found the CPU posted a maximum temperature of just 66 degrees C in our testing on a new Corsair iCue 360mm closed-loop liquid cooler. (Remember, though, that's a 360mm liquid cooler on an i5. Grain of salt and all; an air cooler makes much more sense paired with a CPU of this price.) So with all those tantalizing results in content creation and gaming stacked up on the board, sans some concerning issues with Denuvo DRM, is the Intel Core i5-12600K a slam-dunk for Intel in the midrange? A worthy contender to AMD's onslaught of affordable gaming engines in the Ryzen 3 and Ryzen 5 Series? Not quite yet. We say that because unlike some previous launches, this time around Intel is offering up only a single, premium-level chipset to install your new processor alongside: Z690. That means pricey motherboards, plus new DDR5 RAM (some boards do DDR4, some DDR5; we tested with DDR5) if you want to go that route, plus possibly a new LGA 1700 CPU cooler. The Core i5-12600K doesn't come with a cooler. Go ahead and scroll through our massive Z690 motherboard mega-guide if you like, but to save you the finger strength we'll spoil the ending: The cheapest board you'll find on there starts at $179.99, and to get on-par performance with our results here, you'll also need to spring for that DDR5 memory to boot. What will all that run you? Here's an estimate... For the same price as a barebones 10-core Core i5-12600K system, you could get a similarly outfitted 12-core/24-thread Ryzen 9 5900X build started, and still have just under $80 left over for a gaming mouse or keyboard of your choosing. The Intel Core i5-12600K is shockingly good at content creation in many instances, and if you're looking for a processor that can handle hobbyist workloads for not a ton of money, it's awesome...in isolation. But the Ryzen 9 5900X is still a better bigger-picture deal, due to that overall cost of adoption of Alder Lake. Insult to injury? The Intel UHD XeLP graphics platform continues to trail AMD's Radeon RX Vega graphics in the Ryzen 5 5600G and Ryzen 7 5700G by a lot on IGP-gaming testing. If Intel wants to remain competitive in the eyes of budget PC builders relying on integrated graphics (a fast-growing segment, in today's GPU desert), its XeLP graphics silicon will need significant upgrading in the near future. (Hopefully before AMD's Zen 4 debuts, however unlikely that may be.) Due to the cost of adopting a whole new platform around your CPU, it's rare that a Core i5 chip can stand up as the best value when Intel debuts a new chip stack and platform. Intel just changes its sockets too often, usually every other generation. That goes doubly so for launches like this Alder Lake one, in which only premium Z-series motherboards will be available for at least the next several months. So as a value-centric option, today, the Intel Core i5-12600K needs too much pricey supporting hardware to make it worth it over AMD's relentlessly competitive series of 7nm chiplet-based desktop gaming CPUs. Put aside the overall cost to get in the room with Alder Lake, though, and the Core i5-12600K has a lot going for it, and shows a lot of promise for what's to come for Intel's 7 Process. If you're willing to play the wait-and-see game for less-expensive motherboard platforms in the future, the Intel Core i5-12600K is a strong contender for one of the best midrange processors that the company has launched in years. (As long as it eventually plays AC: Valhalla. Get on that patching, people!) For PC gamers and budget-constrained creative types, Intel's ""Alder Lake"" Core i5-12600K punches well above its weight in gaming and content creation alike. Just know that the cost of adoption (memory, motherboard, cooler) may make waiting a bit to upgrade a better bet.

intel-i5-12400F,tomshardware,"We tested with Windows 11 and DDR4 memory on a Z690 motherboard (B660 isn't available yet). We're using a publicly-available BIOS that allows the chip to meet its rated specifications, but it is possible that future BIOS releases could unlock an extra bit of performance. Additionally, the power monitoring software that we typically use isn't yet optimized for the 12400's power telemetry. As such, we only have sparse power metrics and they could be subject to a bit of variance. We'll update the article with more detailed power measurements once we've sorted that issue.  Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. The Core i5-12400 is a locked chip, but you can overclock the memory on Z- and B-series motherboards. We're sticking with our standard policy of allowing the motherboard to exceed Intel's recommended power limits, provided the chip remains within warrantied operating conditions. Some of our tests use the default lifted PL1 and PL2 restrictions. Almost all enthusiast-class motherboards come with similar settings, so this reflects the out-of-box experience with a high-end motherboard. These lifted power limits can serve as a sort of quasi-overclock (albeit not as effective) that will boost performance in some threaded applications and gaming, all while technically remaining within the definition of stock settings, and thus warrantied. We measured a peak of 98W with the unlimited power settings during a Blender workload, but we'll follow up with more detailed power stats soon. Naturally, these lifted power limits equate to more power consumption, and thus more heat. MSI motherboards also come with a recommended power profile for a stock cooler, which we put to the test to compare performance. However, we don't have a stock cooler for the Core i5-12400 yet, so we used this profile with the Corsair H115i watercooler that we use as a standard on our test benches. We'll add testing with the stock cooler to this article once it arrives. MSI claims the boxed cooler can sustain these settings, but the MTP/PL2 of 169W (128-second Turbo duration) is above Intel's recommended 117W / 56-second boost. We measured a peak of 86W with these settings. We'll add testing with the stock cooler at both 169W/117W MTP settings soon.  We tested the Core i5-12400 in three different configurations: We also tested with secure boot, virtualization support, and fTPM/PTT active to reflect a properly configured Windows 11 install. We have a full breakdown of the test system configurations at the end of the article. As usual, we're testing with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 to reduce GPU-imposed bottlenecks as much as possible, and differences between test subjects will shrink with lesser cards or higher resolutions. Because most of the titles below show little meaningful differentiation at higher resolutions, we only tested four of the seven titles at 1440p. We haven't tested the Core i5-12400 with DDR5 memory yet â we'll wait for an appropriate B660 motherboard â but we've observed that DDR4 is generally comparable to DDR5 in gaming with variances that depend on the title. Additionally, DDR5 is currently subject to eye-watering price premiums that completely remove it as a rational option for this class of chip.

Naturally, moving over to 1440p brings a GPU bottleneck into the equation, so the performance deltas between the chips shrink tremendously. If you game at higher resolutions and don't plan to upgrade your GPU before you buy your next CPU, those results provide a good perspective.

Flipping through the 99th percentile charts for both resolutions also shows larger deltas, but we have to view those with caution as Windows 11 is still young and seems to suffer from more framerate variability than our Windows 10 test platform.

The Core i5-12400 easily beats the Ryzen comparables, but be aware that large performance deltas in a few of the game titles can heavily impact these types of overall measurements. It's always best to make an informed decision based on the types of titles you play frequently, so be sure to check out the individual game benchmarks below.

Overall it's clear that the Core i5-12400 is now the mid-range gaming champion, offering a superior level of performance at its price point with no clear competitors. Synthetic benchmarks don't tend to translate well to real-world gaming, but they do show us the raw amount of compute power exposed to game engines. It's too bad most games don't fully exploit it.  AMD's onslaught against Intel began with a commanding lead in rendering work, particularly Cinebench. However, that lead has waned with the arrival of Alder Lake, as the Core i5-12400 takes a somewhat slim lead over the Ryzen 5 5600X in both the Cinebench single- and multi-threaded tests while taking much more substantial leads over the 5600G, 3600X, and 3600.  The 12400 is particularly strong in single-threaded rendering tasks but equally adept in the threaded benchmarks. Overall, the Core i5-12400 dominates the comparably-priced Ryzen chips in these tests.  AMD's strongest showing in these tests comes from the $300 Ryzen 5 5600X during the C-Ray and Corona benchmarks. The 5600X is also strong in the four Blender renders, but it wins two and loses two, equating to a wash.   The ubiquitous web browser is one of the most frequently used applications. These tests tend to be lightly threaded, so a snappy response time is critical. The Core i5-12400 beats all competing Ryzen processors in Jetstream 2 and ARES-6, but the Ryzen 5 5600X edges past in WebXPRT 3.  We've integrated the UL Benchmarks Procyon tests into our suite to replace the aging PCMark 10. This new benchmark runs complex Adobe Premiere Pro, Photoshop, and Lightroom workflows with the actual software, making for a great real-world test suite.  The Core i5-12400 trails the Ryzen 5 5600X and overclocked 5600G in the Adobe Premiere Pro video editing benchmarks but takes the lead in the Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop photo editing benchmarks.  The Core i5-12400 provides snappy application load times, but the Ryzen 5 5600G and 5600X are faster, which isn't too surprising given their higher price points. Conversely, the 12400 beats all of the competing Ryzen chips in the Microsoft Office suite.  This grab bag of various tests finds the Core i5-12400 scoring several more wins. From the exceedingly branchy code in the LLVM compilation workload to the massively parallel molecular dynamics simulation code in NAMD, the 12400 is impressive. Meanwhile, AMD's higher-end Ryzen 5 5600X carves out wins in the NAMD, compression/decompression, and encryption workloads. Still, all of the price-comparable Ryzen models trail the Core i5-12400 across the entire gamut of tests.  Like the rest of the Alder Lake family, the Core i5-12400 will come to market with disruptive pricing as part of Intel's new bare-knuckle price war with AMD. That's particularly painful as Intel attacks the sub-$200 segment that AMD has largely abandoned.

The ~$185 Core i5-12400 beats the $299 Ryzen 5 5600X and $259 Ryzen 5 5600G in key areas. Putting the Core i5-12400 up against AMD's price-comparable models isn't a fair fight; the Core i5-12400 beats them by huge margins, but that's because the $240 Ryzen 5 3600X and $199 Ryzen 5 3600 leverage the aging Zen 2 architecture.

They're also facing a tremendous competitor. Consider this: With the right tuning, the 12400 is even slightly faster at 1080p gaming than the previous-gen $549 Core i9-11900K flagship at stock settings, which is impressive.

Intel's Alder Lake pricing is solid, but the company's decision to initially bring only Z690 motherboards to market took a bit of the shine off the value proposition at launch. However, we're on the cusp of the release of the more affordable B- and H-series motherboards, which should bring a much lower cost of entry to the Alder Lake platform. Unfortunately, we don't have details of those motherboards to share yet, but we're sure that you'll learn more in the coming days.

Below, we have the geometric mean of our gaming test suite at 1080p and 1440p and a cumulative measure of performance in single- and multi-threaded applications. Remember that we conducted the gaming tests with an RTX 3090, so performance deltas will shrink with lesser cards and higher resolution and fidelity settings.  The Core i5-12400's generational improvements in threaded work are a bit tamer. It is 'only' 12.4% faster than the previous-gen Core i5-11400, but we still see impressive performance over the Ryzen competition. Even though the 5600X carves out some wins in some applications, at stock settings, the 12400 is 2.3% faster than the 5600X in our cumulative measure of threaded work and 6.7% faster after overclocking. That's surprising given the pricing delta.

Frankly, AMD doesn't have any worthy competing chips for threaded work at the 12400's price point. We see larger leads for the 12400 over the Ryzen 5 5600G, 3600X, and 3600, with the Core i5-12400 taking leads of 15.8%, 22.4%, and 23.6%, respectively. That means the Core i5-12400 wins against the price-comparable Ryzen chips in every performance category, and even beats a few of the more expensive models. Of course, you also have to consider that you can get the graphics-less Core i5-12400F for ~$25 less. That's an excellent price point for access to this level of performance. "
intel-i5-12600K,pcmag,"""Alder Lake,"" Intel's 12th Generation family of CPUs, has three primary members at launch: the two go-go-performance parents (the Core i9-12900K and Core i7-12700K), alongside junior (the Core i5-12600K). Well, that kid is precocious: Intel's new Core i5-12600K ($289) desktop CPU may bring up the rear of the company's first set of 12th Gen chips, but it posts some impressive gains over its predecessors in Intel's line. The Core i5-12600K finds itself sandwiched within a series of near-impeccable midrange CPU launches from AMD over the past year, but there's no denying the Core i5-12600K's prowess on display here. It comes within spitting distance of matching the content-creation results of older, former mega-core monsters like the $989 Intel Core i9-10980XE Extreme Edition and the $499 AMD Ryzen 9 3900X. It even manages to beat the 10-core, $449 Core i9-10900K in some of the same tests. That said, its integrated graphics performance is still dwarfed by the similarly threaded, Editors' Choice-winning Ryzen 7 5700G and six-core Ryzen 5 5600G, which provide a much stronger value proposition to gamers looking to build their next rig around a system-on-a-chip (SoC), without a graphics card. If you want serious content creation power out of a chip class that's historically been known for midrange gaming, the Core i5-12600K is certainly equipped for the job. Just be ready to pay a pretty penny to get yours off the ground, thanks to the new (and pricey) Z690 motherboard platform taking tickets at the door. Based off Intel's new ""7 Process,"" the company's 12th Generation desktop CPUs are built on 10nm lithography and employ a new motherboard socket (LGA 1700), finally breaking the company out of its half-decade love/hate affair with the 14nm process and its iterations that followed for years after. You can read more about how Intel defines its ""7 Process"" in-depth at ExtremeTech. You'll notice in the spec chart below some new CPU-core types being thrown around, stuff like ""P-cores"" and ""E-cores."" To find out everything you need to know about those terms and more, check out our full breakdown of Intel's Performance Hybrid Architecture in our in-depth review of the Intel Core i9-12900K, essential reading for understanding what is new in Alder Lake. We won't repeat all that detail here. Though the Ryzen 5 5600X, at first, seems like the obvious AMD foil for a direct comparison to the Intel Core i5-12600K, in practice the Core i5-12600KF would be a more fitting opponent, since neither it nor the AMD chip has on-CPU graphics. (Intel is offering ""KF"" versions of its initial Core i9, i7, and i5 Alder Lake chips, making six total chips at launch.) Instead of focusing on that chip, then, we'll turn our attention to how the Intel Core i5-12600K stacks up against two of the best moderate-priced Ryzen chips we've tested yetâand the ones AMD most recently released in the desktop gaming spaceâthe Ryzen 5 5600G and the Ryzen 7 5700G. These two flank the Core i5-12600K on price, at $239 and $329, respectively. (Those are current street prices; the list prices are $259.99 and $359.99.) And both have integrated AMD Radeon RX Vega integrated graphics that, as we'll show in more detail below, are often capable of standing in for a discrete graphics card when the moment calls. With that brief intro out of the way, let's jump into some specs... As a 12th Gen Intel Core processor, the Core i5-12600K is just like the rest of its Alder Lake kin, bearing two different core types on board: in this case, six performance cores (those ""P-cores"" we mentioned earlier), and four ""E-cores,"" with the ""E"" short for efficiency. These add up to a maximum concurrent-processing-thread count of 16, with only the P-cores getting the two-threads-per-core Hyper-Threading support this time around. On cost, the Intel Core i5-12600K doesn't break any major barriers as far as price creep up the stack is concerned, and it remains slotted right between several members of AMD's Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 chip family, squarely in the midrange. The Intel Core i5-12600K comes with the same integrated graphics as the rest of the ""K""-series CPUs in the 12th Genâthe company's new Iris Xe UHD Graphics 770 siliconâthough ""new"" is a bit disingenuous. The main changes from UHD Graphics 750 are a slightly reduced base clock speed (300MHz, down from 350MHz), and an increased peak dynamic frequency (up to 1.55GHz, from 1GHz). So now that we know what's under the hood of Intel's latest midrange offering, how did it do in testing? Let's jump into the results and see what surprises Intel has in store... We tested the Core i5-12600K on an MSI MPG Z690 Carbon WiFi motherboard, with 32GB of DDR5 Corsair Dominator memory clocked to 4,800MHz, and a 4TB Sabrent Rocket Q4 PCI Express 4.0 boot SSD that also functioned as our game drive. All this was packed in Corsair's iCue 7000D Airflow chassis, fitted with a Corsair iCue H150i Elite Capellix 360mm liquid cooler, and a Corsair 1,000-watt RM1000X power supply. For our gaming tests, we used an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti, at Founders Edition clocks, as we have on all recent mainstream and high-end CPU reviews. We test CPUs using a variety of synthetic benchmarks that offer proprietary scores, as well as real-world tests using consumer apps such as 7-Zip, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Premiere (the Adobe apps being tested with workloads via workstation maker Puget Systems' PugetBench extensions). We also test with multiplayer games like Rainbow Six Siege, and AAA 3D games such as Assassin's Creed Valhalla. First up, CPU tests. These were run on a variety of Windows 10 testbeds that were built fresh for the advent of 12th Generation. We benchmarked all of our listed AMD processors as well as the back-tested Intel ones on Windows 10; due to time constraints, we didn't get to Windows 11 yet, with some additional testing to come on Win 11 for the Alder Lake chips. (The Windows 11 testing will be to bring Intel's Thread Director into play. For more on why that matters, again check out our Core i9-12900K review.) One note here: Since Intel has the platform handicap with the advent of Z690, we tested our AMD Ryzen 9 5950X, AMD's top-end mainstream Ryzen, on the most tricked-out, liquid-cooled system we had on hand, the Maingear Turbo (2021). While graphics tests won't be directly comparable (the RTX 3080 Ti we use, and the RTX 3090 in the Maingear, are a few percentage points apart in most games), the productivity tests of the Maingear, combined with its overkill liquid cooling, should bring a bit more parity between AMD's 16-core Core i9 chip and Intel's latest 16-core offering. But that is just for context, and a sideshow to the Core i5 we are discussing here. Well that is certainly a surprise, to say the least! Again: Bear in mind that these are mostly Windows 10 results. Even without Thread Director calling action from behind the scenes, Intel's latest midrange processor still posted a consistently impressive showing across almost every benchmark we ran. The exception, 7-Zip, acts as a more straightforward representation of the cores' power on their own, while considerable wins in both our Adobe runs with Photoshop and Premiere showcase what a little tuning can do to elevate the Core i5-12600K to some impressive heights. Also, remember: This is a Core i5 chip! Compare it to the Core i9-11900K. The Core i9-11900K wasn't a match for the Core i5-12600K in some of the tests, like Blender and the Adobe Photoshop/Premiere tests, though the 11900K's reduced core count compared to the i9-10900K (eight cores versus 10) already keep it at a content-creation disadvantage versus other recent Core i9s. Two tests that did seem to challenge the chip were POV-Ray and HandBrake. Here both the 12th Gen i5 and i9 limped to the finish line, a problem that will warrant future testing to suss out completely, given the otherwise strong showing in the rest of our benchmarks, especially the real-world Adobe ones. Here's what we saw in our bank of gaming tests with our GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Founders Edition card running the show, under Windows 10. This top-end consumer graphics card is the primary arbiter of performance at 4K with all of the CPUs that we have laid out below. At 1080p, though, the card gets out of the way a bit more and lets the CPU differences shine. (We test with 3DMark Time Spy and three games.) Predictably, the same problem we encountered during our review of the Core i9-12900K reared its head during our games testing of the i5-12600K: Assassin's Creed: Valhalla is unlaunchable on 12th Gen Intel Core chips. As we explained in that review, this is an issue that could be wider than just that, among many titles that use Denuvo DRM, or isolated to just a few. (Intel acknowledged such a thing in our briefings, more about which in the Core i9 review.) We didn't have time to test out any others on this Denuvo list, but as with overall Thread Director testing, we'll be digging deeper over the coming weeks into what the Intel Core 12th Gen stack can (or can't) play in late 2021. In a nutshell: With this issue, Denuvo confuses Alder Lake's two core types for two separate machines, triggering the DRM and crashing the game. Again, much more on that issue in our Core i9-12900K review. [Editor's Note: Intel has released a statement regarding Denuvo functionality on Intel 12th Gen processors. Workarounds are coming, but no determinate figure on when just yet.) The chip recovered a bit with some pace-setting frame rates on Rainbow Six Siege, though at 1080p it's also blowing well past the fastest refresh rates on monitors today. So if you wanted to step down to something like the Ryzen 5 5600G, in this instance it could be the better choice. And speaking of Ryzen 5000G Series chips being the better choice... As a midrange CPU with integrated graphics processing (IGP) on the chip proper, the Intel Core i5-12600K sits on the high end (of the midrange, stick with us) of CPUs that gamers might consider if they're going to build a new gaming system without a discrete graphics card. In today's GPU-starved market, having an IGP that can dutifully stand in for a video card in a pinch is a big selling point. It could make or break the purchase in many gamers' minds. So, with that, how did the company's UHD Graphics 770 (Iris Xe Graphics) fare? Let's find out. Note: These multiplayer results are a combination of our recent testing piece Can You Game Without a Graphics Card? We Tested 11 Desktop CPUs to Find Out in comparable games, along with the most recent results collected from the Intel Core i5-12600K during our testing for this review. Also note: ""WNR"" means ""would not run."" Despite refreshing the onboard graphics of both its latest 12th Gen stack (UHD Graphics 770), as well as 11th Gen (UHD Graphics 750) earlier this year, Intel's IGP platform still can't hold a candle to AMD's aging Radeon RX Vega IGPs. The results are so skewed in favor of AMD and chips like the Ryzen 7 5700G that the value proposition of the Intel Core i5-12600K as a viable SoC for PC gaming without a video card just isn't there. In normal graphics-card stock conditions, we wouldn't hold Intel's feet so close to the fire on this. But this is 2021, in which GPUs are hyper-inflated in price. And given that AMD has Ryzen G-Series CPUs that can clearly stand in for a low-end GPU, all on their own, the value proposition of the i5-12600K takes an inevitable hit if you want to do casual PC gaming off an IGP. That, and the sheer volume of would-not-runs (WNRs) we hit during IGP testing of the i5. Intel's latest graphics drivers provided to us for the Intel Core i5-12600K review were seemingly not quite there yet. We did manage to get a couple runs in F1 2021 to complete, but the full suite is still dominated by AMD's numbers due to so many disqualifications on Intel's end. We'll update this story if a more reliable driver set is released in the next several weeks. A quick note: Due to the increased complexity that's been added to the Z690 platform for overclockers, we'll be publishing a separate article soon that takes a deeper dive into everything that's on offer. In the meantime, for the sake of this review, we chose to run with Intel's latest version of its Extreme Tuning Utility (XTU) and its simple sliders to see what we could get done on a time budget. In those runs on the Core i5-12600K, we were able to achieve a ""good enough for a one-touch slider"" result of just under 10% over boost clock, which translated to around 6% more performance in F1 2021 and the Adobe Photoshop/PugetBench for Photoshop test run. Last up, we tried to push the Intel Core i5-12600K to its thermal limits in a 10-minute run through Cinebench R23 in CoreTemp. We found the CPU posted a maximum temperature of just 66 degrees C in our testing on a new Corsair iCue 360mm closed-loop liquid cooler. (Remember, though, that's a 360mm liquid cooler on an i5. Grain of salt and all; an air cooler makes much more sense paired with a CPU of this price.) So with all those tantalizing results in content creation and gaming stacked up on the board, sans some concerning issues with Denuvo DRM, is the Intel Core i5-12600K a slam-dunk for Intel in the midrange? A worthy contender to AMD's onslaught of affordable gaming engines in the Ryzen 3 and Ryzen 5 Series? Not quite yet. We say that because unlike some previous launches, this time around Intel is offering up only a single, premium-level chipset to install your new processor alongside: Z690. That means pricey motherboards, plus new DDR5 RAM (some boards do DDR4, some DDR5; we tested with DDR5) if you want to go that route, plus possibly a new LGA 1700 CPU cooler. The Core i5-12600K doesn't come with a cooler. Go ahead and scroll through our massive Z690 motherboard mega-guide if you like, but to save you the finger strength we'll spoil the ending: The cheapest board you'll find on there starts at $179.99, and to get on-par performance with our results here, you'll also need to spring for that DDR5 memory to boot. What will all that run you? Here's an estimate... For the same price as a barebones 10-core Core i5-12600K system, you could get a similarly outfitted 12-core/24-thread Ryzen 9 5900X build started, and still have just under $80 left over for a gaming mouse or keyboard of your choosing. The Intel Core i5-12600K is shockingly good at content creation in many instances, and if you're looking for a processor that can handle hobbyist workloads for not a ton of money, it's awesome...in isolation. But the Ryzen 9 5900X is still a better bigger-picture deal, due to that overall cost of adoption of Alder Lake. Insult to injury? The Intel UHD XeLP graphics platform continues to trail AMD's Radeon RX Vega graphics in the Ryzen 5 5600G and Ryzen 7 5700G by a lot on IGP-gaming testing. If Intel wants to remain competitive in the eyes of budget PC builders relying on integrated graphics (a fast-growing segment, in today's GPU desert), its XeLP graphics silicon will need significant upgrading in the near future. (Hopefully before AMD's Zen 4 debuts, however unlikely that may be.) Due to the cost of adopting a whole new platform around your CPU, it's rare that a Core i5 chip can stand up as the best value when Intel debuts a new chip stack and platform. Intel just changes its sockets too often, usually every other generation. That goes doubly so for launches like this Alder Lake one, in which only premium Z-series motherboards will be available for at least the next several months. So as a value-centric option, today, the Intel Core i5-12600K needs too much pricey supporting hardware to make it worth it over AMD's relentlessly competitive series of 7nm chiplet-based desktop gaming CPUs. Put aside the overall cost to get in the room with Alder Lake, though, and the Core i5-12600K has a lot going for it, and shows a lot of promise for what's to come for Intel's 7 Process. If you're willing to play the wait-and-see game for less-expensive motherboard platforms in the future, the Intel Core i5-12600K is a strong contender for one of the best midrange processors that the company has launched in years. (As long as it eventually plays AC: Valhalla. Get on that patching, people!) For PC gamers and budget-constrained creative types, Intel's ""Alder Lake"" Core i5-12600K punches well above its weight in gaming and content creation alike. Just know that the cost of adoption (memory, motherboard, cooler) may make waiting a bit to upgrade a better bet.

intel-i5-12600K,tomshardware,"Alder Lake chips support both DDR4 and DDR5 memory, but there are several caveats tied to DDR5. As a default, DDR5 runs in Gear 2 mode, resulting in higher latency. Additionally, standard motherboards only support DDR5-4800 if the motherboard has only two physical slots. Therefore, at stock settings, Alder Lake only supports DDR5-4400 on any motherboard with four slots â even if only two slots are populated. Support drops as low as DDR5-3600 if four slots are filled with dual-rank memory DIMMs. Here are the population rules for DDR5: And with that, let's take a look at performance in both Windows 10 and 11 on the following pages. "
intel-i5-13400F,pcmag,"The Intel Core i5-13400F ($196) has been available for some time now (and 14th Gen Core ""Raptor Lake Refresh"" chips have since debuted), but it stands out as one of Intel's more affordable 13th Gen Raptor Lake Core i5 processors. Naturally, this makes it a go-to option for PC builders, particularly those building budget gaming PCs, but pricing isnât everything. While it doesn't bring enough punch to earn an Editors' Choice awardâthat laurel stays stuck on the AM4-based AMD Ryzen 7 5700G for nowâthe budget-priced Intel Core i5-13400F is worth your attention for low-cost PC builds. (Just be sure to pair it with an appropriately budget-level graphics card.) By design, the Intel Core i5-13400F is one of Intelâs most affordable Raptor Lake Core i5 processors. Its low price is a compelling selling point but has some negative connotations. Its core count is lower than most 13th Gen Core i5 processors, with six high-performance Performance cores (P-cores) and just four low-power Efficient cores (E-cores). Most other 13th Gen Core i5 processors, like the Intel Core i5-13600K, ship with eight E-cores alongside the six P-cores, which gives them a notable boost in multi-threaded performance compared with the Core i5-13400F. Another key difference is that the Core i5-13400F is slightly cheaper than its non-""F"" Core i5-13400 sibling because it lacks an integrated graphics processor (IGP). This also makes the processor a little more appealing to budget-strapped gamers, who can avoid paying for an IGP they will never use. We find merit in that argument, as you wonât typically use the IGP if you have a graphics card, but I prefer to buy something with an IGP instead where I canâ""just in case."" The IGPs on modern processors arenât powerful options for gaming, but they have other uses. An IGP can power a second monitor that you arenât gaming on, which saves all of your graphics cardâs performance for running your game. Having an IGP can also be useful for troubleshooting issues that can arise later, particularly if your graphics card has problems. Nonetheless, the financial advantages of dropping the IGP and those extra E-cores are undeniable. Instead of costing $319 like the Intel Core i5-13600K, or $220 to $230 for the Core i5-13400 (with an IGP), the Core i5-13400F was introduced at $196. Thatâs significant and could enable you to buy a more powerful graphics card, which would be far more impactful to your gaming experience in most situations than those extra E-cores the Core i5-13600K has. To make the Core i5-13400F even more tantalizing, it comes with one of Intelâs Laminar RM1 stock coolers. Itâs a small thing, but it might work just well enough that you can avoid paying out for an aftermarket thermal solution, which saves you even more cash. Weâll see how this works out a bit later. I tested the Intel Core i5-13400F on a Gigabyte Z790 Aorus Master motherboard with two 16GB sticks of DDR5 memory in a dual-channel configuration. This RAM was operated at the Core i5-13400Fâs maximum officially supported memory speed of 4,800MHz. Other tested CPUs were operated at lower RAM speeds according to their respective supported maximums. A Cooler Master MasterLiquid PL240 Flux 240mm water cooler was utilized to keep the chip from overheating. Power came from a SilverStone DA850 PSU and all tests were performed inside Windows 11. An open-air Praxis Wetbench was used to hold all of the parts during testing. For the game tests with a graphics card, I used an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition. This was also used in the system during all CPU and power tests as a display adapter. As you can see from the chart, the Intel Core i5-13400F came closest to matching the Intel Core i5-12600K in terms of overall specs, with the Core i5-13600K a bit ahead with a few more cores and additional cache. AMD has several processors that compete directly with the Core i5-13400F on a performance level, a few of which you can see in the chart above. While the competing AMD chips have fewer overall cores, their more advanced manufacturing processes and architectural differences could give them the upper hand. Kicking things off with AIDA64 gives us a look at how much raw bandwidth each processor has to work with. With its lower clock speeds and smaller cache pools, the Core i5-13400F turned in lower performance numbers here than most other Intel processors. The Core i5-13400F performed competitively in the Cinebench R23 benchmark. It was among the slower chips that I tested, but it managed to slightly outpace the AMD Ryzen 5 7600 and the AMD Ryzen 5 7600X in the multi-threaded test. In single-threaded mode, however, the AMD competition was considerably faster. Itâs also worth noting the Core i5-12600K was likewise faster in both areas. I ran into an issue while running the PugetBench benchmark in Adobe Photoshop that caused the test to crash toward the end of the run each time. Iâm not entirely sure why this happened and couldnât find a way to fix it. The Premiere Pro test worked just fine, but it again showed Core i5-13400F behind all of the competition. Performance in HandBrake was less than stellar for the Core i5-13400F as well. It beat out the two Ryzen 5 processors again, but not by a wide margin. The Core i5-13400F did a little better in Blender beating out the Ryzen 5 7600X by less than 10%. Finally, in POV-Ray, we again get mixed results with the Core i5-13400F having just slightly better multi-threaded performance but a fair bit worse single-threaded performance. Overall, the Core i5-13400Fâs performance in the CPU-focused benchmark results weren't that impressive. The processorâs gaming performance, however, is arguably far more important given that this chip, without an IGP, is geared toward use with a dedicated card. Results from 3DMarkâs Time Spy benchmark certainly suggested that the Core i5-13400F could do well here. Its performance was far ahead of the two Ryzen 5 processors in this test, and it also beat out the AMD Ryzen 7 8700G, coming close to matching the AMD Ryzen 7 7700X. In F1 22, most of the processors I tested turned in similar performance numbers. A few of the AMD chips turned in lower frame counts and the Ryzen 7 8700G crashed while running the game at anything higher than 1080p, but all this suggests the Core i5-13400F is a better option for playing this game. Marvelâs Guardians of the Galaxy and Total War: Three Kingdoms also showed the processors all turned in results that were too close to each other to give an edge to any one. The legacy title Bioshock: Infinite gave us a lot more to consider. In this game, the Core i5-13400F performed worse than most of the other processors by a significant amount. This is a bit of a red flag, as it suggests itâs not able to pull the max possible performance out of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 that I used for testing. Only the Ryzen 7 8700G performed worse in this test. The 2013 release of Tomb Raider showed the Core i5-13400F perform once again on par with most of the other processors in the test, with the Ryzen 7 8700G still lagging. I measure the total power consumption of the system using a Kill-A-Watt power meter. As a result, our numbers show power consumption from all components and not just the CPU, but as the CPU is the main component being changed, the bulk of any difference shown in the charts here can be ascribed to the processor. Power consumption measurements showed the Core i5-13400F was a bit less power-hungry than the other processors on the list. It beat out the other Core i5 models by a wider margin than I expected it would, and it similarly undercut all of the AMD CPUs. This low power consumption is in part what drove the Core i5-13400F to run so cool while under load. Given its exceptionally low operating temperature, I tested the CPU with its stock Laminar RM1 cooler as well to see if performance would drop or temps would get too high. Surprisingly, performance actually went up slightly, though this is still within the margin of error and more likely a fluke. Naturally, the stock cooler did not keep the Core i5 as cool as the water cooler that I regularly use, but it did a decent job of it nonetheless. The max temperature it reached was just 76 degrees C, which is well within the safety limits of the processor and fine for everyday use. The stock cooler was still a bit of a disappointment, though, as it got distractingly loud during testing. Intel advertises that the coolerâs noise production should only be 29dBA, which would be quieter than most coolers. Yet, when I tested it, when under load this cooler was far louder than the two fans and water pump on the Cooler Master MasterLiquid PL240 Flux. I donât recall the Cooler Master ever getting anywhere near as loud as the Laminar cooler did, not even when used with Core i9 processors. So, while you can use the Laminar cooler safely with the Core i5-13400F, you may want to buy a different cooler just to avoid hearing the Laminarâs fan all day. Budget products are never perfect. After all, the affordable options are typically arrived at by starting with a superior product and scaling it down. Thatâs exactly how the Core i5-13400F came to be, and in some places, its performance clearly lacks. However, Intel set the price of this processor at a highly competitive $196, which is considerably cheaper than all of the other chips we tested for this review. The AMD Ryzen 5 7600 comes closest at $229, but a difference of $30 can be decisive in the budget market. These two processors stand as close rivals. Overall, the Ryzen 5 7600 is the better CPU. Not only did it perform faster more often than not, but it can be overclocked to unlock additional speed. It also has an (admittedly light-hitting) IGP, which not everyone will care about, though we do. At the same time, while the Ryzen 7 7600 is a generally faster processor, the Intel Core i5-13400F is a better-priced chip. It's hard to go wrong with either option, at this point, and so we recommend them both as reliable and powerful-enough entry-level gaming processors for a first-time or budget gaming-rig build. The Intel Core i5-13400F is a well-priced processor that's a fine fit for a budget gaming PC, but don't expect it to pair well with a high-end graphics card.

intel-i5-13400F,tomshardware,"Despite Ryzen's impressive performance, the chips have been plagued by high B-series motherboard pricing and Ryzen's strict requirement for DDR5 memory, both of which lead to higher platform costs. In contrast, Intel's motherboard ecosystem remains less expensive, and the Raptor Lake chips support either value-centric DDR4 or the pricier DDR5. As our tests show, you should only buy the latter if you intend to splurge on a heavily-overclocked kit â at stock settings, a cheap DDR4 memory kit will give you roughly the same gaming performance as a pricey DDR5 kit. Additionally, DDR5 overclocking gains come with eye-pricing markups that largely aren't worth the small uplift.

Like AMD, Intel also throws in a bundled cooler with its lower-end 65W chips to sweeten the deal, and even though we generally recommend buying a better cooler than the bundled models, the Core i5-13400 cooler is at least serviceable for most users.  The $221 Core i5-13400 comes with six performance cores (p-cores) and four efficiency cores (e-cores) etched onto the 'Intel 7' process node, for a total of 10 cores and 16 threads. The 13400 has a $22 markup over the previous-gen Core i5-12400's $199 debut price, but now you get four e-cores instead of zero. In effect, this makes the 13400 very comparable to the $289 previous-gen Core i5-12600K, which also came with six p-cores and four e-cores.

Perhaps most importantly, you can drop down to the $196 Core i5-13400F and receive the same performance â you just lose the 24-EU integrated UHD Graphics 730 engine, so you'll need a discrete GPU.

The Core i5-13400's p-cores have a 2.5 GHz base clock and boost up to 4.6 GHz on two cores in latency-sensitive work. That's 200 MHz faster than the previous-gen 12400 but 300 MHz slower than the 12600K. The e-cores kick in for background and multi-threaded tasks with a 1.8 GHz base and 3.3 GHz boost, a 300 MHz lower boost than the 12600K. The 13400 has a 65W Processor Base Power (PBP) and 148W Maximum Turbo Power (MTP) rating. As you'll see in our power testing, we didn't see the chip exceed 110W in any of our testing, so the MTP rating is higher than needed.

Most other features, like the supported DDR4-3200 and DDR5-5600 transfer rates, 9.5 MB of L2, and 20 MB of L3 cache, are the same as the previous-gen 12600K, and with good reason â Intel uses repurposed Alder Lake silicon for some of the Core i5-13400 chips, just as it did with the Core i5-12400 processors. The two types of dies come with different core architectures, but are designed to offer the same level of performance. As such, the Core i5-13400/F doesn't have the same amount of cache per core as the Raptor Lake Core i7 and i9 chips. Instead, each p-core has 1.25 MB of L2 cache, and the quad-core e-core cluster has only 2MB of cache â the same as Alder Lake. That stands in contrast to the higher-end Raptor models that come with 2MB of L2 per p-core and 4MB of L2 for each e-core cluster. The C0 die is the same silicon that Intel uses for the Alder Lake Core i5 processors, making the Core i5-13400 mostly identical to the Core i5-12600K (our test subject is C0). In contrast, the B0 stepping die comes with the Raptor Cove chip architecture, but has a cut-down cache configuration to match the Alder Lake silicon.  Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. You can find the particulars of our overclock and test setup further below. Here we have the geometric mean of our gaming tests at 1080p and 1440p, with each resolution split into its own chart. We're testing with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 to reduce GPU-imposed bottlenecks as much as possible, and differences between test subjects will shrink with lesser cards or higher resolutions and fidelity. You'll find further game-by-game breakdowns below. We have testing in the thermal and overclocking section that shows there is little to no performance loss in gaming if you use the 13400's included stock cooler, even with the power limits enforced â we saw no difference with the box cooler in 1080p gaming, and the stock cooler was 1.2% slower at 1440p (close enough to call a tie). To maintain a level playing field, we removed the power limits and used our H115i cooler for these tests.

The 13400's support for DDR4 memory is key in this price range, as it still costs nearly half as much as DDR5. Overall we see a difference of 1 fps between DRR4 and DDR5, with DDR4 coming out on top by a mere 0.6% â meaning the two Core i5-13400 configs offer basically the same performance.

We did get ~3% more performance from DDR5-6800 than we did with DDR4-3600, but the DDR5 kit costs nearly three times as much as the DDR4 kit ($144 more). You could step back to a DDR5-6000 kit that 'only' costs twice as much, but neither of those DDR5 options makes much sense in this price range.

The Core i5-13400 is 7% faster than the previous-gen Core i5-12400, but despite the physical similarities between the 13400 and the 12600K, the latter is still ~3% faster on the strength of its higher clock rates. That's a pretty slim delta, though, considering the 13400's lower pricing and big improvements in productivity applications.

The stock $229 Ryzen 5 7600 is 7% faster than the stock $221 Core i5-13400 with DDR5/DDR4 in the 1080p tests. Overclocking the 7600 increases the delta over the overclocked 13400 DDR5 system to 9%, and 12% over the overclocked DDR4 config. However, the 7600 carries a ~$30 premium over the 13400F. Adding in the higher motherboard and memory costs associated with the AM5 platform also takes a toll, as you can see in our value analysis in the conclusion.

Some have pointed to the $190 Ryzen 7 5700X as an alternative here, but the Core i5-13400 is 7% faster at 1080p. Given the 5700X is only $10 less than the 13400F, comes without a cooler, has lower performance than the 13400F in productivity apps, and uses an older platform, our test data suggests it is really only a contender for an upgrader currently on an AM4 platform.

The deltas in these charts can be slim, and large deltas in individual game titles, like with the 5800X3D, impact cumulative measurements. The competition between AMD and Intel chips can vary based on the title (particularly with DDR4 vs DDR5) and the GPU you use. It's best to make an informed decision based on the types of titles you frequently play, so be sure to check out the individual tests below. The Ryzen 5 7600 takes a strong lead in Cyberpunk 2077, while the Core i5-13400 trails across the board, even after overclocking the memory.  The Ryzen 7 5800X3D continues to not provide much performance uplift over the standard Zen 3 models, which is important to remember â not all games benefit from the 3D cache-stacking tech.  Far Cry 6 is very memory latency-sensitive, and here we can see that the DDR4 Core i5-13400 config in Gear 1 exceeds the DDR5 memory, which runs in the higher-latency Gear 2 mode, despite DDR5's throughput advantage. The DDR4 config even leads after stepping up to the relatively tame DDR4-3600 memory overclock, beating the DDR5-6800 config.

Meanwhile, the Ryzen 5 7600 edges past the Core i5-13400 in stock trim and takes an even bigger lead after overclocking.  F1 2021 finds the Ryzen chips again taking substantial leads over the Core i5-13400, but that isn't entirely surprising given their higher pricing.    Here we can see the increased throughput of DDR5 memory having more of an impact in Hitman 3. This title also makes good use of the e-cores, thus delivering a more substantial lead over the previous-gen Core i5-12400.  Back in the more realistic land for mid-range gamers, the Core i5-13400 does much better with DDR4 memory than with DDR5, indicating that this title prefers lower latency accesses over sheer bandwidth. In fact, the Core i5-13400 with DDR4 is faster than the Core i5-12600K, which is tested with DDR5 memory. Flipping over to the 1440p charts shows us that higher resolutions are often the great equalizer that levels the playing field for chips with similar accommodations.  We can boil down productivity application performance into two broad categories: single- and multi-threaded. These slides show the geometric mean of performance in several of our most important tests in each category, but be sure to look at the expanded results below.

The Core i5-13400 with either DDR4 or DDR5 offers the same performance in our cumulative metrics for single- and multi-threaded work, though there will be certain applications that can take better advantage of DDR5's increased throughput. Conversely, some applications will prefer the lower latency of DDR4.

All configurations of the Core i5-13400 match the Ryzen 5 7600 in single-threaded work, but overclocking the 7600 gives it a 4.5% lead. Meanwhile, the Ryzen 5 7600X stretches its legs and leads by 8%, but that comes with a higher price tag. Turning to multi-threaded productivity applications, the 13400 with DDR4 and DDR5 is 5.5% faster than the Ryzen 5 7600 at stock settings and keeps a similar 5% lead after overclocking the 13400's memory and the Ryzen 5 7600. Meanwhile, the Ryzen 5 7600X is 2.5% faster than the Core i5-13400 in both stock and overclocked configs.  The Core i5-13400's e-cores deliver a solid 16% boost in threaded work and a 4% boost in single-threaded tasks over its predecessor, the Core i5-12400. However, the 13400's relatively tame clock speed improvements ensure that it doesn't beat the 12600K, which leads by 7% in both single- and multi-threaded applications.

We saw no decline in gaming performance or single-threaded apps with the 13400's bundled cooler when we limited the chip to the stock 65W/148W power limits, but we did see a difference in multi-threaded applications â the chip was 5% slower with the power limits and stock cooler than it was with the H115i 280mm water cooler.  The Raptor Lake Core i5-13400 rivals or beats AMD's like-priced Ryzen 5 7600 in nearly all single- and multi-threaded rendering applications, with the single-threaded Cinebench R23 benchmark being the lone exception.  Most encoders tend to be either heavily threaded or almost exclusively single-threaded â it takes an agile chip to master both disciplines. Handbrake, SVT-HEVC, and SVT-AV1 serve as our threaded encoders, while LAME, FLAC, and WebP are indicative of how the chips handle lightly-threaded engines.    The Core i5-13400 navigates the threaded workloads well, but trails in many of the lightly-threaded encoders. Again, we have to take pricing into account, as the Ryzen competitors carry higher price tags.  The Ryzen processors dominate in the Adobe and Office applications across the board.  This selection of tests runs the gamut from the exceedingly branchy code in the LLVM compilation workload to the massively parallel molecular dynamics simulation code in NAMD to encryption and compression/decompression performance. Y-cruncher computes Pi with the AVX instruction set, making for an exceedingly demanding benchmark.  Our tests show that using the box cooler doesn't meaningfully impact gaming performance, even if you also lock the chip to the recommended 65W/148W power limit. The entry labeled ""Core i5-13400"" in the above charts represents the chip topped with a Corsair H115i 280mm liquid cooler and all power limits removed, while the ""StockPL Box"" setup measures performance with the bundled stock ""box"" cooler and fully-enforced 65W/148W power limits. We saw no difference with the box cooler in 1080p gaming, and the stock cooler was 1.2% slower at 1440p (close enough to call a tie).  We also measured the difference in productivity applications. Unsurprisingly, there isn't any difference in single-threaded work, regardless of configuration. However, enforcing the power limits with the boxed cooler produces roughly 5% less performance in multi-threaded work.

To determine the source of the disparity, we re-ran the same tests with the box cooler and no power limits (listed as ""Core i5-13400 NoPL Box""). Removing the power limits while still using the box fan brought the performance in threaded apps back up to par with the watercooler, showing that the cooler has enough thermal headroom to run heavy threaded apps without power limits imposed. That's an interesting result, so we tested it further.  To remove thermals as a limitation, we always use the same 280mm Corsair H115i AIO cooler for all our test systems. This time we used the same three test configurations â the 280mm watercooler without power limits, the box fan without power limits (and its original pre-applied TIM), and the box fan with power limits â to measure performance in heavier work.  We ran Prime95 first, but be aware that this stress test serves as a power virus more than an actual representation of most threaded work; real-world apps simply do not consume as much power or generate as much heat. The chart is a bit of an eye sore, but the takeaway is that even though the box fan without power limits (Box NoPL) ran at the 100C limit during the test with the chip throttling, it only lost 100 MHz of frequency (2.5%) on the p-cores compared to the watercooled configuration. Meanwhile, imposing the 65W/148W power limits dropped clocks to 3.4 GHz, a whopping 21% decline from the results with the liquid cooler.  Prime95 is a stress test and not very indicative of normal use, so we then ran a looped series of POV-Ray benchmarks to see performance over time with a more realistic workload. Here we can see that the chip didn't exceed 90C with the power limits removed, and that clock rates between the watercooled and box cooler were the same. We then turned to even more standard productivity applications.  To reiterate the point with a broader selection of real-world benchmarks, we ran our standard series of heavily multi-threaded apps like y-cruncher, HandBrake, Cinebench, Blender, and POV-Ray.  The first slide shows that the box cooler with no power limits never exceeded 90C during these tests, showing that it is adequate to handle extended real-world workloads. This test shows the chip delivering the same 4.1 GHz all-core frequency as the 280mm AIO configuration. Meanwhile, imposing power limits is often 500 MHz slower.  The stock cooler isn't silent, so you'll have to accept the extra noise. However, the takeaway is that the box cooler is good enough to handle the chip at the lower 65W/148W power limits and adequate for multi-threaded real-world workloads with the power limits removed. Not that removing the power limits is too taxing â the Core i5-13400 peaked at 110W in our tests, which is far under the 148W official Maximum Turbo Power.  However, you could run into slightly more throttling if you run a heavy extended-duration heavy workload for an hour or more or have higher ambient temps (our tests were at ~74F ambient). However, the loss would be slight, and you would still come out ahead over running the chip at the recommended 65W power limits.  We would recommend investing in a $20 tower air cooler to reduce the noise level and ensure 100% operation, but it isn't a steadfast requirement if you're willing to accept the drawbacks.  The Core i5-13400's power consumption is surprisingly good, especially given that our test chip uses the Alder Lake C0 die. The Ryzen 5 7600 is more power efficient in our renders-per-day metric and consumes less power in every workload, but the deltas aren't large enough to be of concern for most users. The Core i5-13400 is very power efficient in these workloads, largely due to the addition of four e-cores. That confers a generational improvement against the Core i5-12400 in both performance and power consumed.  The $221 Core i5-13400 and the graphics-less $196 Core i5-13400F build on the gaming performance of the previous-gen model that has long been the go-to mid-range gaming chip, but the addition of four e-cores drastically improves performance in threaded productivity workloads. The 13400's support for DDR4 memory gives it an unmatched value proposition in the $200 price range, making it the go-to chip for mid-range gaming PCs.

Below, we have the geometric mean of our gaming test suite at 1080p and 1440p and a cumulative measure of performance in single- and multi-threaded applications. We conducted our gaming tests with an Nvidia RTX 4090, so performance deltas will shrink with lesser cards and higher resolution and fidelity settings. The $221 Core i5-13400 is 7% faster than the previous-gen Core i5-12400, a decent generational improvement. However, its main competitor comes in the form of the $229 Ryzen 5 7600, which is 7% faster than the Core i5-13400 at stock and overclocked settings in our 1080p tests. But the pricing between these two chips isn't as close as it appears.

The optimum low-cost build would also use the $196 graphics-less Core i5-13400F â it doesn't have an iGPU but offers the same performance as the normal model â to save another $25. You also have the option to stick with less expensive DDR4 memory with the Core i5-13400/F and get the same gaming performance as DDR5, albeit at the cost of some overclocking headroom with DDR5.

However, the last few percent of gaming performance from DDR5 overclocking is ridiculously expensive. With the Core i5-13400, we gained ~3% more gaming performance from the DDR5-6800 kit over the DDR4-3600 config, but the DDR5 kit costs nearly three times as much ($144 more). Stepping back to a DDR5-6000 kit that 'only' costs twice as much as the DDR4 kit doesn't make much sense in this price range, either. The AMD Ryzen 5 7600 profited more from overclocking with a 6% gain (some of this comes from PBO, though), and since there's no option for DDR4, you'll pay around 21% more over the already-pricey DDR5-5200 kit.

The Core i5-13400/F's DDR4 option combined with the generally much more forgiving Intel motherboard pricing can save ~$135 in total system costs compared to the Ryzen 5 7600. We typically don't include cost-per-frame analysis due to fickle component pricing, and including several components magnifies the pricing volatility. This won't be applicable after a month or so (be sure to check current pricing), but the above table gives us the needed nuance for the Core i5-13400 vs Ryzen 5 7600 debate.

The DDR4-powered Core i5-13400F system is the absolute lowest-cost solution at $381 compared to the 7600's $514 â you'll pay 35% more for the Ryzen system and ~25% more per frame to get the ~7% increase in 1080p gaming performance.

The $229 Ryzen 5 7600 isn't price-competitive with the Core i5-13400 DDR4 system at all, but it is more attractive if you already plan to shell out the extra cash for DDR5. However, there's a higher pricing bar for entry than with an Intel Core i5-13400 DDR5 system. The Ryzen system costs ~$50 (10%) more than the DDR5-powered Core i5-13400F system, or ~4% more per frame when we factor in performance. That's close enough to make the Ryzen 5 7600 a solid choice for a DDR5 gaming system, provided you have the extra $50 in the build budget.

Thus, DDR5 builders might turn to other factors, like the 7600's performance in applications (it's 5% slower than the 13400 in threaded work), or the fact that the AM5 platform is supported until 2025+ while the Raptor Lake platforms only have one more refresh gen in the cards. Intel's CPU cores also aren't overclockable (memory is), while Ryzen is fully unlocked. Naturally, personal preference also weighs in.  Both chips are evenly matched in single-threaded productivity applications, but the Core i5-13400 with DDR4 and DDR5 is 5.5% faster than the Ryzen 5 7600 in threaded workloads at both stock and overclocked settings. Again, DDR4 and DDR5 provide similar performance with the 13400 in productivity apps, both at stock and overclocked settings. DDR5 simply isn't worth it.

The 13400's four e-cores provide extra horsepower that helps with streaming â programs like OBS are designed to take advantage â and the additional cores don't add too much power consumption. If you're looking for a more productivity-focused chip, the Core i5-13500 looks very compelling with eight total e-cores; stay tuned for that review. The Core i5-13400 does suck more power than the Ryzen 5 7600, but it is reasonable, which helps reduce heat output. Both the 13400 and the 7600 come with bundled 'box' coolers, and even though it is surprising, the Intel cooler is serviceable.  As always, we recommend upgrading to a $20 tower-style air cooler for this class of chip, but it isn't a requirement. The Intel cooler is more than adequate with the recommended power limits and can even handle strenuous work with the power limits fully removed. You could run into throttling if you run a heavy extended-duration heavy workload for an hour or more, but you would still come out ahead over running the chip at the recommended 65/148W power limits.

The Ryzen 5 7600 is a worthy alternative if you plan on upgrading to DDR5, but you will have to stomach the higher price of entry over Core i5-13400 systems that use both DDR4 and DDR5. That doesn't seem as reasonable in this price range.

With DDR5, the Core i5-13400 offers a lower price of entry and higher performance in threaded workloads. Even though it is 7% slower in gaming, it still has a competitive price-to-performance ratio with the competing AMD chips â but you don't need DDR5 to unlock the best performance.

When paired with DDR4, the Core i5-13400 generally provides the same performance as a DDR5 system but delivers a superior price-to-performance ratio in both gaming and productivity applications. Add in the unmatched entry-level platform pricing, and the Core i5-13400 is the best bang for your buck in the ~$200 price range, making it the mid-range gaming CPU leader."
intel-i5-13500,pcmag,"By design, Intelâs Core i5 processors are never the fastest CPUs on the market, but they are consistently are one of the best choices for smart, value-minded PC gaming. Thatâs to be expected with each new release, as these chips aim to provide solid performance, but at a lower price than Intelâs higher-end Core i7 and Core i9 chips. The new 13th Gen ""Raptor Lake"" Core i5-13600K, priced at $329, holds true to form, even exceeding our expectations for a Core i5. Unless you are on a tight budget or have oodles of cash to spend, itâs hard to recommend buying anything else if you're willing to go with Intel's LGA 1700 platform for your next gaming-first PC. For that, we award the Intel Core i5-13600K our Editors' Choice laurel for mainstream gaming CPUs. Architecturally, Intelâs 13th Gen Raptor Lake Core processors are not new; Raptor Lake is a direct evolution of Intelâs 12th Gen Core architecture, better known as ""Alder Lake."" Alder Lake itself was revolutionary, introducing the use of two distinct CPU core types inside of a single processor. Intel defines the cores used inside of these chips as high-octane Performance cores (P-cores) or lower-power Efficient cores (E-cores). The P-cores are the real backbone of the design, with all 12th Gen and 13th Gen processors having at least some P-cores. The E-cores have so far been more selectively allocated in certain chip models. Many Alder Lake processors didnât have any E-cores, but those that did gained a major performance boost in some usage cases from the extra cores onboard. Just like Alder Lake, Raptor Lake continues to use this design, with the most notable change being an increase in core counts, clock speeds, and cache. The Core i5-13600K ships with six P-cores that can operate at up to 5.1GHz, and it also has eight E-cores that top out at 3.9GHz. The P-cores also support Hyper-Threading technology, to further boost multi-threaded performance. The last-gen Core i5-12600K also shipped with six Hyper-Threaded P-cores that were clocked just slightly lower at 4.9GHz. But the Core i5-12600K had just four E-cores, clocked at 3.6GHz. The increase in clock speed helps the Core i5-13600K some, but clearly most of the performance boost inherent in the Core i5-13600K comes from its doubling of the count of E-cores. Itâs also notable that the Core i5-13600K has 24MB of L3 cache, 4MB more than the Core i5-12600K. Thatâs in addition to 20MB of L2 cache, which is slightly more than double the 9.5MB of L2 cache found on the Core i5-12600K. Other than that, there are only a few minor changes between the processors. The other changes inherent in the Core i5-13600K is a faster DDR5 memory controller that supports DDR5 up to 5,600MHz. Also, it has a negligibly higher-clocked integrated graphics processor (IGP) that runs just 50MHz faster. The IGP itself didnât change, though; both come equipped with an Intel UHD Graphics 770 IGP. The Core i5-13600K does have a higher power limit of 181 watts (181W) compared to the Core i5-12600K, but with the increase in core count this is not surprising. For all its positive attributes, there is at least one somewhat concerning factor we should point out: the processorâs price. With an MSRP of $329, the Core i5-13600K costs $40 more than its predecessor did at launch. (The Core i5-12600K launched at $289.) Not taking performance into consideration, itâs disheartening to see the entry price for any Core i5 processor, even a deluxe, unlocked ""K"" one, now sitting north of $300. The big concern we have here: The climbing price of Core i5 processors will also likely mean budget-friendly options released further down the road will also cost more. This is a trend we have seen far too much of in recent years, and Intel certainly isnât alone here, but that doesnât counter our disappointment at this generational price increase. We tested the Core i5-13600K on our recently refreshed LGA 1700 test bed. It uses a Gigabyte Z790 Aorus Master motherboard with two 16GB sticks of DDR5 RAM in a dual-channel configuration operating at 5,600MHz. All of the CPUs tested are paired with an equal quantity of RAM clocked at each CPU's highest officially supported RAM clock speed (5,200MHz for all Ryzen 7000 processors, 4,800MHz for all Alder Lake processors). All processors are cooled by a Cooler Master MasterLiquid PL240 Flux 240mm water cooler, and each system is powered by a SilverStone DA850 PSU. To minimize the impact of heat on the test systems, we employ a Praxis Wetbench open-air chassis. All benchmarks are run under Windows 11, and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition graphics card is used for all tests except the integrated graphics tests. Though the Core i5-12600K is the direct predecessor of the Core i5-13600K, this new processor lines up closer in spec to the Core i7-12700K, which is closer in core count, cache amount, and power limit. Comparing AMDâs AM4 processors to Intelâs new Raptor Lake processors is difficult, as the two companies now use very different designs but price-wise, the AMD Ryzen 7 7700X costs a fair deal more than the Core i5-13600K. Lets see if itâs worth that extra cost. (Spoiler: Itâs not!) Intel may have increased the size of the L2 caches on its Raptor Lake processors, but their overall speed has not improved much. Read and write performance of the L2 cache is up slightly versus the Core i5-12600K, but overall performance in this area lags far behind AMD. The larger size of the L2 cache should still help performance, though, as it reduces the chance that the processor will need to go to the L3 cache or system memory for data. In contrast to the L2 cache performance, the L3 cache is surprisingly fast, and it actually manages to outperform the L2 cache in raw bandwidth. Memory bandwidth is also excellent. The DDR5 in this test system is clocked slightly higher than the DDR5 used with the competing AMD AM5 processors, but only by a mere 8%, which means the far larger gap in performance we see in this chart is due at least in part to the performance of the memory controller and not just the RAM itself. Arguably, the Core i5-13600K makes the best argument so far for Intelâs new processor-design philosophy. Those smaller, lower-performance E-cores are cheaper to produce than the big cores by design, but they still pack some serious firepower. This is made clear by the Core i5-13600Kâs CPU test results. In most of the CPU tests, the Core i5-13600K handily outperforms the Core i7-12700K. The Core i7-12700K entered the market at $409 last year and has almost as many cores, with a total of 12 (eight P-cores, four E-cores). The Core i5-13600K costs $80 less with two fewer P-cores, twice as many E-cores, and 8MB more L2 cache. Given this information, it seemed likely that these processors would trade places, depending on the test, but instead the Core i5-13600K performs better in every test. It doesn't win by a wide margin in some tests, but it does win. The Core i5-12600K, for its part, was left in the dust, and the Core i5-13600K even manages to perform slightly better than the 16-core Ryzen 9 7950X in a few tests. (That said, the Core i5 lost to the 16-core/32-thread Ryzen 9 7950X badly in most tests, as you'd expect.) AMDâs Ryzen 7 7700X is a more evenly matched opponent for the Core i5-13600K, but here Intel has some notable advantages. The Core i5-13600K beats the Ryzen 7 7700X in seven out of eight tests, though again some of these are by slim margins. The one test where the Core i5-13600K doesn't post a better score is in Adobe Photoshop, a slim win for the Ryzen 7 7700X. If you factor in that the Ryzen 7 7700X costs $170 more than the Core i5-13600K, then it becomes difficult to argue in favor of the Ryzen 7 7700X. Gaming is traditionally a strong point for Intelâs Core i5 processors. They may not be the fastest processors money can buy, but they typically perform well enough so as to not seriously bottleneck the graphics card. In general, this is what we see with the Core i5-13600K paired with our Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 benchmark card. In a few cases (Bioshock: Infinite, Marvelâs Guardians Of The Galaxy), the Core i9-13900K shows a slight performance advantage, but these advantages are trivial and selective. Itâs hard to make a strong argument for a more powerful processor for your gaming PC with such negligible upside gained for much more money. Indeed, as far as gaming is concerned, itâs hard to make a strong argument for any of the processors in the chart above except the Core i5-13600K and the AMD Ryzen 7 5700X. The Core i5 hangs with the best of them and is priced lower than most of its competition. Its direct predecessor is available for $40 less, and the Ryzen 7 5700X starts at $299, but both of those also come with a sizable drop in performance. The AMD Ryzen 7 5700X, for its part, is a bit slower in most games, but it also cheaper, making it a strong budget option if the AMD AM4 platform (and, maybe reusing some DDR4 memory) is the best option for you. The integrated graphics test results are becoming rather predictable for us at this point, as Intel is utilizing the same IGP on all of the 12th and 13th Gen Intel Core chips tested. The clock speed that the IGP operates at varies from chip to chip, and the new Raptor Lake IGPs are likely benefiting from the faster memory controller built into the CPU. But fundamentally, they are the same. As a result, these chips fall neatly in line in most tests. Intel's Core i5-13600K's IGP does demonstrate a modest performance gain over its direct predecessor in most tests, but it is outpaced by the Core i9-13900K's IGP in all tests. The one exception where the Core i5-13600K performs slower than the Core i5-12600K is in Tomb Raider, which appears to stress the CPU more. This enables the Core i5-12600K to pull ahead, not because it has the fastest CPU in the bunch, but because its slower CPU doesnât get quite as hot, allowing the IGP to run better, with more thermal headroom. We monitor the power consumption of the entire system during a few tests to garner a rough idea of the processorâs power consumption. The number reported is the peak power consumption shown during that test as read at the wall by a Kill-A-Watt meter. Overall, the Core i5 shows excellent power consumption readings during our tests. It peaks at 471W during our Adobe Premiere test, which is the lowest of any of the CPUs we tested for comparison. Intel's Core i5 pulls slightly more power in the Cinebench test than the competing Ryzen 7 7700X, but it also performs slightly better in that test, which makes this a rather mixed result. The Core i5-13600Kâs thermal performance is also excellent relative to its overall speed. All of these CPUs were tested using the same CPU cooler and with a fresh application of thermal paste, so none of them has an unfair advantage. Though the Core i5-13600K does run considerably hotter than its predecessor, it also runs significantly cooler than the Core i7-12700K, which it marginally outperforms. This leaves the door open to some amount of overclocking, as the Core i5-13600Kâs thermal ceiling is 100 degrees Câjust like the Core i9-13900K. Intel's relative price increase with the Core i5-13600K is unwelcome. But weâve run our tests and cannot deny that the Core i5-13600K still offers exceptional performance for what you pay. Sure, it isn't as fast as the Core i9-13900K or the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X in CPU tests (those flagships have a big core-count advantage), but in games with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080âor anything weaker. reallyâit is more than a match for these two higher-end CPUs. When it comes to the more immediate competition, like the AMD Ryzen 7 7700X, the Core i5-13600K places AMD in a rather difficult situation. The AMD Ryzen 7 7700X is simply slower than the Core i5-13600K, and it costs $70 more too! Even with a price drop to match the Core i5-13600K, the Core i5 remains the better option. Unless AMD wants to cut the Ryzen 7 7700X to cost less than the Core i5-13600K, it is going to be a very tough sell. The Ryzen 5 7600X, which we havenât finished testing yet, may fare better in a relative sense, as it is priced lower. However, for now, our main recommendation to most gamers is going to be to buy an Intel Core i5-13600K. Intel's Core i5-13600K is pricier, power-hungrier, and hotter-running than its predecessor, but it's hard to argue with the raw performance this CPU gives you for the money, especially for PC gamers.

intel-i5-13500,tomshardware,"According to the Bilibili video, the Core i5-13500 engineering sample features a single-core turbo frequency of 4.8 GHz or 4.9 GHz - depending on the monitoring software shown, and an all-core frequency of 4.4 GHz. The efficiency cores peak at 3.4 GHz, with all cores going down to 3.3 GHz. The single-threaded results aren't very imposing, with the Core i5-13500 pulling out a 9% lead over the Core i5-12500 in Cinebench R23, with a score of 1,901 vs. Tech Notice's score of 1,736 for the Core i5-12500. Unfortunately, we couldn't get a CPU-Z single-threaded result since the video's image quality was too blurry to make out any detail. Nonetheless, a 9% lead is not bad for an engineering sample since these chips are usually lower clocked than the production models. As a result, we might see noticeably higher single-threaded performance and clock speeds, on the full production models, compared to what we are seeing today. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. But, the most impressive results from the Core i5-13500 undoubtedly come from the multi-core results. Intel's decision to add a full eight E-cores to its budget-end Core i5-13500 is providing Intel's mid-range offering a serious performance jump over its Alder Lake predecessor. However, whether the Core i5-13500 offers a tremendous leap in gaming performance remains to be seen."

intel-i5-13600K,tomshardware,"The 13th-Gen Intel 'Raptor Lake' $589 Core i9-13900K and the $319 Core i5-13600K bring groundbreaking levels of performance to their respective price points, with a ~20% generational jump in gaming performance taking the lead over competing chips from AMDs Ryzen 7000 series. We tested all three of the new Raptor Lake chips with the new Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 to find the best CPU for gaming and the new leader of our CPU benchmark hierarchy. Raptor Lakes performance gains come from record-high clock speeds that stretch up to 5.8 GHz, with a 6 GHz model coming, while Intels generous sprinkling of more cores throughout its product stack gives it the lead in core counts for the first time since AMDs Ryzen debuted back in 2017.In many respects, Raptor Lake is an iteration of the microarchitectures found in the previous-gen Alder Lake chips, but with expansive improvements that yield explosive performance gains. Even though Intel still uses the Intel 7 process node, it leveraged impressive advances in a newer revision of the silicon to push clock speeds higher while improving power efficiency. Intel also etched the cores on a new, larger die with more cores and L3 cache and exposed previously unused L2 cache.Paired with fine-grained tuning and expanded use of features in the core, Raptor Lake yields the types of performance gains we would normally only expect from the transition to a new process node. Those types of advances are needed as Intel attempts to fend off the 5nm Ryzen 7000 processors, like the Ryzen 9 7950X and Ryzen 5 7600X, that recently took the lead over Alder Lake.Like its predecessor, Raptor Lake supports the latest connectivity standards, including PCIe 5.0 and DDR5, with the latter now supporting faster official speeds of DDR5-5600. Intel also preserves DDR4 support for less-expensive build options - a pronounced advantage over AMDs Ryzen 7000, especially on midrange options. Raptor Lake will also drop into existing motherboards to offer an upgrade path for Alder Lake users, but new 700-series motherboards offer slightly expanded connectivity options. Intel also introduced more CPU overclocking features.Of course, there are caveats. Intels new chips are its most power-efficient yet, but like AMD, Intel has taken a power-be-damned approach to regain leadership, dialing up its power limits for all the desktop PC chips. That means the heat can be hard to control, so youll need to plan for a beefy cooling solution. On the flip side, you can now easily overclock to the highest clock rates weve ever seen, and that's even without using exotic cooling. For instance, we dialed in 5.6 GHz all-core overclocks with relative ease with an AIO watercooler.Intel did raise the price of the Core i5-13600K model, but it kept the same pricing for the Core i7 and i9. With the companys continued aggressive chip pricing and options for lower-priced platforms and memory, the 13th-Gen Raptor Lake processors are now the best CPUs for gaming and most other work, even if they dont take the outright performance lead in all threaded workloads.Intel's initial Raptor Lake launch includes three overclockable chips, and each has two variants, giving you the option for cheaper graphics-less KF-series models. Intel is expected to release the remaining 16 processors in the lineup early next year. Just like the previous-gen chips, the 13th-Gen Raptor Lake processors come with a mix of both big performance cores (p-cores) for latency-sensitive work and small efficiency cores (e-cores) for threaded and background applications. The e-cores stick with the same Gracemont architecture as before, but the p-cores move from the Golden Cove design to Raptor Cove. We'll cover the architecture more in-depth after the benchmarks.The 24-core 32-thread $589 Core i9-13900K will square off with AMD's 16-core $699 Ryzen 9 7950X, so Intel has a pricing advantage. The Core i9-13900K has the highest clock rates of the new chips, with a 600 MHz generational improvement bringing it to a 5.8 GHz peak that sets a record for mainstream desktop PCs. Intel employs Thermal Velocity Boost and Turbo Boost 3.0 tech for the Raptor Lake Core i9 models, so the 13900K will have to meet certain temperature (under 70C) and power conditions to boost to 5.8 GHz on two cores. Intel has also raised the boost frequencies for both p-cores and e-cores on all Raptor Lake chips, but reduced the base clocks by 200 MHz. The latter shouldn't mean much in practical application - this is done to manage the Base Turbo Power (BTP) rating.The 13900K has the same 125W BTP as before, but Intel increased the Maximum Turbo Power (MTP) by 12W, bringing it to 253W. Thats a new height for desktop processors, outstripping Ryzen 7000s peak 230W rating.The Core i9-13900K has eight more e-cores than its predecessor, delivering much more threaded horsepower and technically taking the core count lead on the mainstream desktop PC over the 16-core Ryzen 9 7950X. In contrast, AMDs design employs only cores that are analogous to performance cores, so well have to look to the benchmarks to suss out the winners instead of relying upon core counts alone. The e-cores come with a 400 MHz increase to the boost clock, bringing them to 4.3 GHz. Even though the e-cores use the same Gracemont architecture, Intel claims that changes to the caching policy and other fine-grained optimizations (more below) now yield the same IPC and frequency as the original 14nm Skylake cores, but at lower power.The Core i9-13900K is the only Raptor Lake chip to come with Intel's Adaptive Boost Technology (ABT). In a nutshell, ABT allows Core i9 processors to dynamically boost to higher all-core frequencies based upon available thermal headroom and electrical conditions, so the peak frequencies can vary. It also allows the chip to operate at 100C during normal operation to extract the utmost performance from your setup. We cover this more on the third page.The $409 Core i7-13700K received a 400 MHz p-core frequency bump to 5.4 GHz, an additional four e-cores for a total of eight, and a 400 MHz e-core boost to 4.2 GHz. Intel also increased the MTP for this chip to 253W, a 63W increase over the prior-gen Core i7-12700K (+33%).The $319 Core i5-13600K has four more e-cores than the prior gen, and Intel increased the p-core clocks by 200 MHz to reach 5.1 GHz. Intel also bumped the e-cores up by 300 MHz to achieve a 3.9 GHz boost. Naturally, this means the chip will consume more power - the 13600K also has a 31W higher MTP than the prior gen, weighing in at 181W (+20%).The Core i5-13600K looks to be the most impressive Raptor Lake chip if youre willing to overclock, as we easily attained a 5.6 GHz overclock that nearly matches the stock Core i9-13900Ks gaming performance. Youll have to pay for the privilege, though. The $319 Core i3-13600K is the lone chip to receive a price increase; both the full-fledged model and the graphics-less 13600KF are $30 more expensive than the prior gen. Intel has confirmed that e-cores are also coming to more of the Raptor Lake Core i5 lineup. Currently, only the Core i5 'K' Alder Lake model has four e-cores, while the others do not.Some of the improvements apply to all three chips. For example, Intel increased the L2 cache from 1.25MB to 2MB for each p-core and doubled the amount of L2 cache for each cluster of e-cores to 4MB. The amount of L3 cache has also increased due to adding more e-core clusters, each of which has an adjacent L3 cache slice as part of the design. That leads to cache capacity increases for all K-series Raptor Lake chips.Intel has increased its DDR5 memory support up to 5600 MT/s if you use one DIMM per channel (1DPC), a big increase over the prior 4800 MT/s speed with Alder Lake. Just as importantly, Intel increased 2DPC speeds up to 4400 MT/s, an improvement over the previous-gen 3600 MT/s. Raptor Lake also continues to support DDR4 memory, which Intel predicts will coexist in the market with DDR5 until the end of 2024. This approach ensures a value option for Intel platforms, unlike AMD's all-in approach with DDR5.Both Raptor Lake and Alder Lake drop into motherboards with the LGA 1700 socket, so theyll both work with existing 600-series or new 700-series chipsets. Intel says that, on a like-for-like basis, you shouldnt see any performance differences if you use a previous-gen 600-series motherboard for Raptor Lake. As usual, Intel will bring its Z-series (Z790, in this case) motherboards to market first, with the value-centric B- and H-series coming when it launches the rest of the Raptor Lake lineup.The 700-series motherboards bring minor improvements over the 600-series, but Intel has increased the number of PCIe 4.0 lanes hanging off the chipset to 20, an increase of eight additional lanes. Intel also added support for one more USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 200Gps port, bringing the total to five. As before, the Raptor Lake chip itself supports 16 lanes of PCIe 5.0 and four lanes of PCIe 4.0 for a storage device.Intel doesnt include a cooler with the Raptor Lake processors but recommends a 280mm AIO watercooler or air equivalent (or greater). Existing LGA 1700 coolers are compatible with the new Raptor Lake motherboards but bear in mind that the performance of your cooler can significantly limit performance, so it's best to overprovision. Youll need to ensure you have a beefy cooler for stock operation with the Core i9 and i7 models, and even an overclocked Core i5-13600K can challenge lower-end 240mm AIOs.The Raptor Lake iGPU is based on the same Xe-LP Gen 12.2 architecture found with Alder Lake. Aside from minor clock speed improvements, there arent any changes to the iGPU, so you shouldnt expect any meaningful gaming performance."
intel-i5-14600K,pcmag,"Intelâs Core i5-13600K has been a competitive processor since it launched last year, with speedy performance for an on-point price in its class. The chip has done so well that it appears Intel thought it would be smart to practically re-release that processor as the Intel Core i5-14600K. This 14th Gen refresh of the processor does come with a few advantages, including a marginally higher clock speed and a $10 lower MSRP of $319, but is it the best gaming chip of 2023 or just the same old chip with a new coat of paint? In truth, itâs the latter, except Intel didnât even spring for the high-gloss stuff. We stand by our recommendation of the Core i5-13600K instead. Saying that Intel's Core i5-14600K and the Intel Core i5-13600K are the same chip is true in almost every detail including their use of the 13th Gen ""Raptor Lake"" architecture. Both chips ship with six high-speed Performance cores and eight power-sipping Efficient cores. They also have 24MB of L3 cache each, along with 20MB of L2 cache. In terms of clock speed, the P-cores on both chips have a base clock of 3.5GHz and a max turbo of 5.3GHz with no change. The E-cores are also similar, with both chips' E-cores having a base clock of 2.6GHz. The only notable difference is that the Core i5-13600Kâs E-cores can boost to just 3.9GHz whereas the Core i5-14600K is able to hit 4GHz with its E-cores. All of the secondary features of the chip are likewise unchanged, with both chips having support for DDR5 clocked at a max official speed of 5,600MHz and identical PCI Express and connectivity support. Both chips likewise come equipped with Intelâs UHD Graphics 770 integrated graphics processor (IGP). This IGP contains 32 execution units with eight shaders in each for a total of 256 shaders. The IGP also has 16 texture mapping units (TMUs) and eight render output units (ROPs), with the shader resources clocked at 1.5GHz on the Core i5-13600K and at 1.55GHz on the Core i5-14600K. The Intel Core i5-14600K was tested on a Gigabyte Z790 Aorus Master motherboard with a Cooler Master MasterLiquid PL240 Flux 240mm water cooler. The processor had access to 32GB of DDR5 RAM clocked at the processorâs max officially supported memory speed of 5,600MHz. The system was also equipped with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 graphics card that was used for the gaming tests and as a display adapter for all non-gaming tests. The card was removed from the system for testing the processorâs integrated graphics, though. The system is powered by a SilverStone DA850 850-watt power supply and built into a Praxis Wetbench open-air chassis with a 1TB NVMe PCIe 4.0 SSD. All tests were performed inside of Windows 11 with the latest Windows updates. Bandwidth measurements for the 14600K were in range of the 13600K but didnât show any significant difference between the two chips. Given the near identical clock speeds on the 14600K and 13600K, itâs not surprising that they performed near identically here, too. Bandwidth for the Core i5 chips was overall competitive with AMDâs Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 chips that were tested but fell short of competing with the faster Ryzen 9 processors in terms of cache bandwidth. The trend of the Core i5-13600K and the Core i5-14600K performing similarly continued in all of our processor benchmarks. We saw some small âwinsâ for both chips, though these likely were due to minor variations while running the tests. For example, the Core i5-14600K showed a 4% performance improvement in Cinebenchâs multi-threaded test, but the Core i5-13600K was roughly 3% faster in Adobe Photoshop. It's not enough delta to draw any strong conclusions based on. Realistically, these results suggest what we already know from the specs: The Core i5-13600K and the Core i5-14600K are more or less the same chip in practical terms, even if the specs vary a smidge. Performance versus the AMD Ryzen 7 7700X and AMD Ryzen 5 7600X remained competitive, with the two Core i5 processors far ahead of their rivals in all tests except for Adobe Photoshop, which let the Ryzen 7 7700X have a rare win. Intelâs Core i5 processors are often favorites in the gaming community for their quick performance and relative budget prices versus i7 and i9 offerings. This holds up in our gaming tests. In 3DMarkâs Time Spy test, the Core i5-14600Kâs CPU subscore was notably behind the other Raptor Lake refresh chips, like the Core i7-14700K and the Core i9-14900K, but this didnât carry over to in-game benchmarks. You'll find a few minor areas in the games we tested in which the faster processors, like the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D, the Intel Core i9-13900K and the Intel Core i9-14900K, gain a few small wins over the rest of the pack. This is notable in Marvelâs Guardians of the Galaxy for the Core i9-13900K, Total War Three Kingdoms for the Ryzen 9 7950X3D, and Bioshock Infinite for the Core i9-14900K. These wins, however, were slim, and the Core i5-14600K and the Core i5-13600K tied for first place against the faster and more expensive competition in all of the other tests. This suggests that so long as you have a graphics card on the level of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 or anything slower, you really have no need to buy any of these faster and more costly processors for gaming and gaming alone. They're mainly relevant from a pure-gaming perspective if you're trying to compete in the upper echelon of esports with a high-refresh monitor and a top-end video card like the GeForce RTX 4090. (Of course, you might want the extra CPU horsepower for other non-gaming tasks, which is a whole other matter.) The Core i5-14600K and the Core i5-13600K will do just fine. The performance of the Intel UHD Graphics 770 on the Core i5-14600K is in line with the other previous-generation Intel processors weâve tested, all of which use the exact same IGP. Here again the Core i9 processors showed a touch more performance but not enough to make a real difference. In truth, itâs unlikely that many will use the integrated graphics on these processors for gaming, but if you wanted to, these tests show you could actually game decently even without a GPU. Older games, like Bioshock Infinite and Tomb Raider, both of which were tested with their highest graphics preset, remained playable at 720p. Turning down settings slightly would likewise make them playable at 1080p. Naturally, the IGP is also perfectly workable for non-gaming graphics tasks. AMDâs Ryzen processors have performed better than Intelâs chips in terms of power consumption and heat generation in recent years, and this is notable in our charts. Intel was able to fight back against this somewhat with its Core i5 processors, though. The power consumption here was measured using a Kill-A-Watt wall meter and includes the total power consumption of the system as a whole, not just the processor. But this still gives us a rough idea of how each chip performs with everything else unchanged. AMDâs Ryzen 9 and Ryzen 7 chips might have handily undercut their Core i9 and Core i7 competitors in terms of power consumption, but Intelâs Core i5 processors put up a respectable fight against the Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 CPUs. The Core i5-14600K managed to pull less power overall while running the Adobe Premiere Pro PugetBench benchmark, though this was reversed when running Cinebench. Given the Core i5âs competitive performance compared with the Ryzen 7 7700X, we can clearly see that the Core i5-14600K and Core i5-13600K provide more efficiency overall. This is a bit less certain with the Ryzen 5 7600X, though, as its Cinebench power consumption was considerably lower. The Core i5-14600K and Core i5-13600K were some of the only processors weâve tested in the last year that didn't hit their thermal limit under load. They were the only chips that didn't in this chart. Regardless, the Core i5-14900K hitting 89 degrees C is still quite hot, and that it ran a bit hotter than the 13600K is also disappointing. Realize, too, that this is under a 240mm liquid cooler that costs a significant fraction of the cost of this chip. No stock cooler comes in the box. All in all, the Core i5-14600K did exactly as we expected in testing, matching the Core i5-13600K in almost every way. However, the difference is so slim as to leave us questioning why we would recommend it over the previous generation. We canât really see any advantage to owning the Core i5-14600K over the Core i5-13600K, and we actually can see some disadvantages to it. In terms of pricing, the Core i5-14600K has an MSRP that is $10 lower than the Core i5-13600K currently, but that doesnât matter when the Core i5-13600K sells for even less from retailers at the time of writing. You could buy a Core i5-14600K for $319, or an identically performing, slightly less power-hungry, and mildly cooler Core i5-13600K for $285. Knowing all that, you have only one clear choice. You also have motherboard compatibility to consider, as the Core i5-13600K will also work on all Intel 700-series motherboards without issue, whereas a BIOS update might be required to make the Core i5-14600K run. We canât really say the Core i5-14600K is a poor processor, as it performs just as well as the Core i5-13600K and beats several of its AMD competitors like the Ryzen 7 7700X. But, simply put, if you can buy the Core i5-13600K for less, then that is unquestionably the processor you should buy. The Intel Core i5-14600K is near-indistinguishable from the Core i5-13600K in benchmark results. It's a fine-performing processor in its price class, but we see little reason to buy it if the 13th Gen model is available for less.

intel-i5-14600K,tomshardware,"Here we can see how the 14th-gen chips stack up against AMD's Ryzen family. The Core i9-14900K wields the same eight hyperthreaded Raptor Cove P-cores (performance) and 16 single-threaded E-cores as the Core i9-13900K, but Intel increased the base/boost speeds by 100 to 200 MHz. As mentioned, the Core i7-14700K gains four more E-cores and a 200 MHz higher boost frequency for the P-cores, along with a 100 MHz increase to the E-core boost speed.

The Core i5-14600K gets the smallest of improvements over the previous-gen 13600K, with a mere 100 MHz increase to the E-core boost clocks. As you would expect, we only saw slight performance gains over the 13600K in our testing, so this chip would be a tough sell to an upgrader who could instead opt for a previous-gen model for less cash.

Intel also offers all three chips in graphics-less KF-series configurations for slightly less cash than their full-featured counterparts. In contrast to prior generations, Intel will forge all three of its K-series models from the same die instead of relying upon a cut-down die for some Core i5 SKUs.

Intel hasn't detailed the improvements it made to the 'Intel 7' node, but we do know that it has an enhanced voltage/frequency curve that allows Intel to deliver the increased clocks within the same official power specifications as the prior gen. As usual, your cooling solution will play a big part in your attainable boost speeds â Intel recommends a 360mm-class radiator for the best performance with the higher-tier models.

The 14th-Gen chips are backward compatible with existing 600- and 700-series motherboards and LGA1700 coolers, and motherboard vendors have released a refreshed lineup of Z790 boards along with the new chips. Many of these new models tout more robust power delivery along with Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, and USB Gen 3.2 connectivity.

Intel continues to support dual-channel DDR4-3200 and up to DDR5-5600 for 1DPC (1R/2R) and DDR5-4400 for 2DPC (1 DIMM) setups, but says that P-core, E-core, and memory overclocking are improved. A range of new XMP kits will also arrive soon with up to DDR5-8000 speeds, and specialty (and probably exceptionally pricey) XMP kits will even range up to DDR5-8600. However, Intel notes that DDR5-6000 to DDR5-6600 remains the sweet spot for the best price-to-performance ratio. We also have to caution that the bleeding-edge kits require expensive motherboards, and not all integrated memory controllers (IMC) are created equal â you'll likely need some luck in the silicon lottery to reach the highest peak memory speeds. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. The Ryzen 7000X3D chips take such a large lead in this title that we retested just to make sure â twice. This large advantage is amazing but doesn't represent Ryzen 7000X3D's performance in most titles. It also illustrates how outliers can make the X3D seem more impressive in cumulative measurements. It's worth noting that Borderlands 3 was an AMD promotional title, and that likely plays a role in its performance. The 14900K is fast enough at this title to land within a few imperceptible fps of the Ryzen 9 7950X3D. As we've seen over several of these benchmarks, you'll have to look much lower on the chart than the Core chips to find the standard Ryzen 7000 models. Far Cry 6 was another AMD-promoted game, though only the 7800X3D truly excels thanks to its single-CCD design. The 7900X3D and 7950X3D hold slim leads over the 14900K, with the latter being more prone to lower minimum FPS. The non-X3D Ryzen chips again land below most of the Core chips. Hitman 3 leverages Intel's E-cores for certain game functions, but it's clear that it also loves Ryzen X3D's voluminous L3 cache. Again, the Intel processors maintain impressive leads over the standard Ryzen 7000 models.  Minecraft can be taxing on the CPU in some scenarios, and here we've devised a CPU benchmark by leveraging the built-in test in the Portal Pioneers RTX ray-tracing benchmark. However, we disable ray-tracing to limit the GPU overhead during this test and dial up the render distance to the maximum 95 chunks â though we also dial up the resolution to 4K, since Minecraft runs at your desktop resolution. Then we simply hop into the minecart and take a ride around the track, which gives us a nice repeatable scene for benchmarking.

The Intel chips largely lead the Ryzen contenders, but the Ryzen 7 7800X3D once again proves impressive with its single-CCD design. As you can see, Minecraft's engine doesn't mesh as well with the dual-CCD Ryzen 9 7950X and 7900X.  Microsoft Flight Simulator 2021 obviously benefits tremendously from L3 cache âRyzen 7000X3D is simply incredible in this title. This is the exception rather than the rule, but for cases like this, AMD's X3D chips can run over 25% faster than Intel's chips at 1080p and 1440p. Watch Dogs Legion also favors AMD's X3D chips â not by quite the large margins as Flight Simulator, but the 7950X3D this time comes out on top, while the 7800X3D lands between that and the 7900X3D. Here's a fun little benchmark â I've been toying with different Factorio benchmarking parameters to build out a test. This remains a work in progress and doesn't impact our cumulative measurements, but it does show that there are plenty of examples of engines that prefer access to a massive L3 cache... and a single-CCD design. We can boil down productivity application performance into two broad categories: single- and multi-threaded. These slides show the geometric mean of performance in several of our most important tests in each category, but be sure to look at the expanded results below.

We're switching focus a bit with this selection of tests â we're highlighting AMD's standard Ryzen 7000 chips as they're more fit for heavy productivity work. As you'll see, the X3D chips aren't quite as good of a bang for your buck if you're more interested in productivity work.

The Ryzen 9 7950X is ~2% faster than the Core i9-14900K in our cumulative measurement of multi-threaded workloads. That means these chips are closely enough matched that you'll see them trade blows throughout our threaded benchmarks below. However, the 14900K is 18% faster than the Ryzen 9 7950X in single-threaded work, which typically equates to a snappier system. High single-threaded performance is also advantageous for complex workflows that have diverse requirements.

The Core i9-14900K only beats its predecessor, the 13900K, by 1% in multi-threaded applications and 3% in single-threaded applications, showing that it isn't worthy of a direct-gen-on-gen upgrade. In fact, it doesn't do much to change the competitive positioning of the Core i9 K-series.

The Core i5-14600K shows a bit more uplift over the 13600K â it's 4% faster in single- and multi-threaded work. However, the 13600K is currently ~$35 less expensive than the 14600K, and that gap might increase over time. Again, this chip is ever-so-slightly better, but that also doesn't do much to change the competitive landscape versus Ryzen.

The Core i7-14700K is the real standout here. Courtesy of the additional E-cores, it's 14% faster in threaded work than the 14600K, and it's also 10% faster than the competing Ryzen 9 7900X.

The Core i7 lineup has slowly crept closer to Core i9 over the years in gaming, essentially landing within a few percentage points of performance for ~$180 less. Here we can see that creep happening in threaded applications, too: The previous-gen 13900K was 28% faster than the 13700K, but the 14900K is only 14% faster than the 14700K. In tandem with the very similar gaming performance, the Core i7 is now an even more stellar deal if you're looking for a solid, affordable all-rounder.  We've added Cinebench 2024 to our benchmark suite, but we're also keeping Cinebench R23 around for historical perspective. The Core i9-14900K delivers strong performance in this benchmark, but the Ryzen 9 7950X tends to outperform in Blender.

Overall, these two chips are closely matched in terms of threaded horsepower. You'll also notice that the 13900K often slightly edges out the 14900K, but that's because the two chips are nearly identical â at times, the difference can land within the standard deviation of the benchmark, especially if its a workload that's sensitive to cache or memory throughput.

The Core i7-14700K shows its chops, widening Core i7's lead over the 7900X throughout the threaded workloads.  Most encoders tend to be either heavily threaded or almost exclusively single-threaded â it takes an agile chip to master both disciplines. Handbrake, SVT-HEVC, and SVT-AV1 serve as our threaded encoders, while LAME, FLAC, and WebP are indicative of how the chips handle lightly-threaded engines. This selection of tests runs the gamut from massively parallel molecular dynamics simulation code in NAMD to compression/decompression performance. Y-cruncher computes Pi with the AVX instruction set, making for an exceedingly demanding benchmark. This benchmark was recently updated with specific tuning for AMD's AVX-512 implementation, and here we can see the new code delivering a big boost to Ryzen. Unfortunately for us, power increases in a non-linear fashion as a chip nears the top of its absolute capabilities â in other words, you have to pump in increasingly higher amounts of voltage to extract smaller gains. Nowhere is that more evident than the trajectory from Alder Lake to Raptor Lake, and now the Raptor Lake Refresh.

As you can see, the 14th-gen processors pull far more power than the 13th-gen models, with a peak of 385W with the Core i9-14900K, though average power use was lower at 339W over the benchmark run. That amount of power consumption generates a tremendous amount of heat, so thermals will limit your performance if you don't invest in a robust cooler. As we saw with Raptor Lake, Intel's boosting mechanism will push power as far as it can go while staying under the chip's maximum allowable temperature â those power limits are just higher now. Intel's Raptor Lake drew more power than its predecessor, but the performance gains worked out to be a net win for power efficiency. As you can see in our renders-per-day-per watt power efficiency chart, the 14th-gen chips have sacrificed that efficiency entirely to eke out single-digit-percentage performance gains. Meanwhile, the 7000X3D chips run at lower frequencies than their standard Ryzen 7000 counterparts, a necessity due to their fragile 3D-stacked cache, but that results in exceptional power efficiency.  The final image takes a slightly different look at power consumption by calculating the cumulative energy required to execute an x265 HandBrake workload. We plot this 'task energy' value in Kilojoules on the left side of the chart.

These workloads are comprised of a fixed amount of work, so we can plot the task energy against the time required to finish the job (bottom axis), thus generating a really useful power chart. Bear in mind that faster compute times and lower task energy requirements are ideal. That means processors that fall the closest to the bottom left corner of the chart are the best.  The 14th-gen Raptor Lake Refresh Core i9-14900K and Core i5-1600K processors provide slim upgrades over the 13th-gen models and don't materially change the overall competitive landscape. In contrast, the Core i7-14700K's four extra E-cores provide a tangible uplift in threaded applications that improves Core i7's overall value proposition.

Below, we have the geometric mean of our gaming test suite at 1080p and 1440p and a cumulative measure of performance in single- and multi-threaded applications. We conducted our gaming tests with an Nvidia RTX 4090, so performance deltas will shrink with lesser cards and higher resolution and fidelity settings. The above slides are cumulative measurements, and the Ryzen 7000X3D's 3D V-Cache tech doesnât accelerate all titles equally â you should check our individual game and productivity benchmarks in the preceding sections to make an informed decision based on your workload.

The Core i9-14900K is a lackluster refresh for gamers and 'regular' users alike, with gen-on-gen gains in both gaming and productivity applications often landing in the low single-digit percentages. For instance, the 14900K is a mere 3% faster than the previous-gen 13900K in 1080p gaming, and that isn't nearly enough to cover the large gap between it and the Ryzen 7000X3D processors. For now, the Ryzen 7000X3D lineup remains the fastest overall gaming chips on the market.

However, while the Core i9-14900K isn't the king of the hill for gaming, the Ryzen 7000X3D processors tend to lag in productivity applications. AMD has its lineup of standard Ryzen 7000 processors for those use cases, leaving customers to choose between two lineups with drastically different strengths. In contrast, the 14900K offers a better blend of performance in both disciplines. If you're in need of a strong all-rounder, the Core i9-14900K fits the bill, just as the Core i9-13900K does now.

However, Intel had to increase power consumption yet again to eke out those tiny performance gains â power increases non-linearly when you're at the top of the voltage/frequency curve â and that means the Core i9-14900K will require pricey supporting componentry, like a robust cooler, motherboard, and power supply, to extract the best performance. If you decide on a 14900K, make sure to take those additional costs into consideration.

The Core i5-14600K only brings 100 extra MHz of E-core boost clocks to the table, and that isn't enough to make a substantial difference to its competitive positioning, either. The previous-gen 13600K has been on sale for as low as $285, or roughly $35 less, muddying the water for potential upgraders. However, as with the 14900K, the chip does offer a balanced performance profile that some will find attractive. It's just the exact same profile as before.

We don't know the exact timeline of AMD's next desktop processor release or how those chips will perform. As a result, across the full breadth of the stack, the 'refreshed' picture seems pretty similar to what we saw with the original Raptor Lake chips: If gaming is all you care about, go with an X3D chip if you can afford it. If you're looking for a balanced chip that can handle gaming and excel at productivity-focused work, too, the Raptor Lake (and Refresh) chips are a good choice. However, the generational difference between the Core i5 and i9 chips is so small that upgraders will be better off buying an older chip when it inevitably goes on sale.

In contrast, the Core i7-14700K looks more attractive than the Core i9 and i5 models. It's tangibly faster than the older 13700K, thus earning its higher price tag, and it's also faster than the competing productivity-focused chip from AMD. It's also only 3% slower than the 14900K in gaming but costs $180 less. Finally, the four extra E-cores make it much closer to the 14900K in productivity apps now, delivering a solid price-to-performance ratio that will undoubtedly cannibalize Intel's Core i9 sales."
intel-i7-10700K,pcmag,"The Intel Core i7-11700K ($399 MSRP) is the eight-core, 16-thread desktop CPU that the Core i9-11900K should have been. The AMD Ryzen 7 5800X mostly beats it in flat-out performance, but the Core i7-11700K's reasonably competitive pricing (especially if you can find it at a discount) keeps the contest from being a runaway. Clear of many of the BIOS problems we ran into while testing the Core i9-11900K at launch, the Core i7-11700K shows that with a bit of platform maturity and some more aggressive pricing, Intel's not out of the desktop processor race just yet. To start off, if you'd prefer a deeper dive into all the 11th Generation goodness we've got to spare (including info on motherboard compatibility and cost of adoption), head on over to our review of the Core i9-11900K flagship for all the details. For now, here's how the various CPUs in the ""Rocket Lake"" lineup shake out. (Note that for legibility's sake we've left out the low-power 35-watt ""T"" versions of these chips, which will be of interest mostly to OEMs.) Let's zoom in on the Core i7-11700K's placement in the stack against similar Intel processors, as well as what the competition is up to over at AMD: No, you're not seeing double: Intel really has released two eight-core processors in its 11th Gen stack, with the $539 eight-core, 16-thread Core i9-11900K (a downgrade from last year's 10-core, 20-thread Intel Core i9-10900K) matching the Core i7-11700K nearly spec for spec, save for differences in the max boost capabilities and maximum memory clock speeds. First up is the max boost clock: the Core i7-11700K tops out at 5.0GHz in very specific usage scenarios, while the Core i9-11900K is rated to peak at 5.3GHz (for a more detailed breakdown of how Intel is classifying boost speeds these days, see that review). As for the max memory speed, Intel claims the Core i7 part is locked to DDR4-2933 while the i9 supports up to DDR4-3200. Overall, though, with just those two slight differences between chips priced $140 apart, there's almost no scenario where the Core i7-11700K isn't the better choice if you're looking for an eight-core, 11th Gen Intel processor. Moving on to our AMD matchup, comparing the Intel Core i7-11700K to the Editors' Choice award-winning Ryzen 7 5800X is an uphill battle across the board. The AMD processor outdoes the Core i7-11700K in almost every way except price and single-core boost limits (which don't always translate to single-core wins, as you'll see below), including a 105-watt TDP (versus the Core i7's 125-watt rating), a larger 32MB versus 16MB L3 cache, and compatibility with AMD's venerable Socket AM4 (although motherboard support gets spottier for 5000 Series CPUs compared to the older, cheaper 3000 Series). For one area where Intel's 11th Generation wins, the Core i7-11700K includes a new Intel UHD Graphics 750 integrated graphics processor (IGP). However, if you're going to rely on integrated graphics for gaming, we'd recommend going with a much cheaper option such as the Core i5-11600K, which, while not reliably competitive with AMD's Ryzen 5 3400G, still provides a decent uplift in gaming performance compared to the Core i5-10600K. Finally, Intel has no plans to include a bundled cooler with its Core i7-11700K, which makes sense once you move beyond six-core options up to the eight-core tier. But you'll have to factor the cooler cost into the equation, assuming you don't have an LGA1200-compatible one on hand already. For stock running, air cooling should do. We tested the Core i7-11700K on an Asus ROG Maximus XIII Hero (Wi-Fi) Z590 motherboard, with 16GB of G.Skill memory clocked to 3,000MHz (for comparability with our earlier CPU reviews), and a Mushkin Pilot-E PCI Express 3.0 solid-state boot drive paired with a Samsung SSD 860 QVO SATA secondary drive. All this was packed in an ADATA XPG Invader chassis fitted with a Deepcool GamerStorm Captain 240 EX 240mm liquid cooler and an 850-watt MSI MPG A850GF power supply. For our gaming tests, we used an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, at Founders Edition clocks, as we have on all recent mainstream and high-end CPU reviews. We test processors using a variety of synthetic benchmarks that offer proprietary scores, as well as real-world tests using consumer apps like 7-Zip and 3D games such as Far Cry 5. Over the last couple of years, Intel's midrange options have struggled against AMD's in productivity tasks. That's because with the 9th Generation Core line, Intel nixed thread-doubling Hyper-Threading Technology below the Core i9 level. The company restored it with 10th Gen and it's here again with 11th Gen Rocket Lake. As a chip that backports Intel's 10-nanometer ""Ice Lake"" architecture into 14nm+++ lithography, the Core i7-11700K, like the rest of 11th Gen so far, struggles against AMD's Ryzen 5000 Series and its 7nm chiplet design. The Ryzen 7 5800X beats the Core i7-11700K in every single benchmark we run, save for our legacy iTunes AAC conversion test and (by one second) our Blender 3D model render. Though we expected the Intel chip to trail the AMD, the other single-core losses are especially sore points given Intel's usual strongholds in that area. As for the chip's performance versus the Core i9-11900K, it's a value win across the board. Sure, the Core i9 is regularly ahead of the i7, but not by $140 worthânot even close. This is the only eight-core Intel 11th Generation chip you should consider in most cases, although that's less a plug for the Core i7 than a condemnation of the Core i9. Here's what we saw in our bank of gaming tests with our GeForce RTX 2080 Ti card running the show. This top-end consumer GPU is the primary arbiter of performance at 4K with all of the CPUs that we have laid out below. At 1080p resolution, however, the card gets out of the way a bit more and lets the CPU differences shine.  In the gaming race, AMD once again showed that it has no intention of handing easy wins to Intel anymore. While the Ryzen 7 5800X does lose quite a few battles to the Core i7-11700K throughout our runs, the margin is far too close to ignore the cost of adoption that the Z590 platform demands compared to Socket AM4. Intel has its frame rate victories, to be sure, but on a value basis we'd still recommend the Ryzen 7 5800X as the best eight-core option for gamers on shelves right now. If you'll settle for six cores, the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X and even the Intel Core i5-11600K hit the best price/performance balance overall for desktop gaming for 2021. The Core i7-11700K never topped 80 degrees C in our stress testing, which is oddly lower than the Core i5-11600K during the same run. We checked this result in three separate runs, but no matter the circumstance the Core i7 always ran cooler than the Core i5. A strange result to be sure! Even with a newer BIOS installed on our Asus Z590 motherboard since the launch of Intel's 11th Gen desktop chips back in March, we still hit the same stability issues that arose during our attempts to overclock both the Core i9-11900K and the Core i5-11600K. While the chip would now power on with a slight (5%) overclock applied, attempting to run any games or benchmarks quickly summoned a Blue Screen of Death. If you want to overclock an eight-core chip, the Ryzen 7 5800X and the older Core i7-10700K are more stable bets. As a straight-up competitor to Editors' Choice prize-winning CPUs like the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X, Intel's Core i7-11700K can't quite keep pace. Its slower performance, platform upgrade requirement, and increased power draw (plus the heat output that comes with it) put it a few steps behind what AMD has on offer this year. The main selling point for this processor, as has been the case for most other Intel 11th Gen parts, is availability. Retailers' stock of AMD processors remains stretched as the semiconductor pinch hits overseas outfits like TSMC the hardest, while Intel, with its domestic production, has had an easier time filling shelves through one of the biggest semiconductor shortages in decades. At this writing, you can not only find a Core i7-11700K in stock at all major online outlets, you can even get one on discount at places like Micro Center where the chip was selling for $40 under MSRP (just $360 a pop). For comparison's sake, while Amazon had the Ryzen 7 5800X back in stock at this writing, it was selling for $420âa discount from the $449 MSRP, to be sure, but still substantially more than what you'd pay for a Core i7-11700K on its own. Pricing on the chip has wavered up and down for months, when you've been able to find it in stock. But for Intel's 11th Gen, buying a chip without a new Z590 or lesser 500-Series-chipet motherboard simply isn't an option, possibly erasing the value lead the Core i7-11700K may temporarily enjoy. For Z490 owners or those looking to shop on discount, the older Core i7-10700K is still a fine processor in its own right, but the Core i7-11700K and the rest of its generation don't do enough to justify the higher cost of Z590 adoption based on performance alone. If you want the best eight-core processor that Intel makes today, the Core i7-11700K is it. However, only Intel loyalists are likely to do that; AMD's Ryzen 7 5800X and 3700X are both still the preferred choices if you can find them at or below MSRP. That's the big ""if,"" thoughâand what keeps our rating on the Rocket Lake Core i7 as high as it is. If you're looking for the best eight-core processor in Intel's 11th Generation ""Rocket Lake"" lineup, the Core i7-11700K has got your CPU cycles (and your PC gaming) covered.

intel-i7-10700K,tomshardware,"The Intel Core i7-10700K also comes with a 3.8-GHz base clock that, paired with its 16 threads, improves its standing against price-comparable Ryzen processors in threaded desktop PC applications, while the snappy single-threaded performance gives it an outright win in lightly-threaded apps. The Core i7-10700K also proves to be a nimble overclocker that doesn't generate an untenable amount of excess heat, so off-the-shelf water coolers can unlock big gains.  Overall, the Core i7-10700K gives you nearly the same gaming performance as the Core i9-10900K, but for $110 less, and overclocking eliminates any meaningful difference in gaming performance between the chips. You also get extremely competitive single-threaded performance at stock settings.  The biggest change to the Core i7 series comes in the form of more threads at the same price points as previous-gen i7 models, which equates to a lower price-per-thread. Intel's graphics-less F-series 10700K also stands out with a $25 discount.  The 10700K doesn't have a direct Ryzen 3000 competitor on the pricing front yet, with the ~$415 Ryzen 9 3900X serving as a step up with 12 cores and 24 threads, while the $329 Ryzen 7 3800X lands at a lower price point. We expect that to change when AMD releases its Radeon XT models, with the $399 Ryzen 7 3800XT serving as the 10700K's direct competitor.  In many respects, the Core i7-10700K is similar, if not better, than the previous-gen Core i9-9900K. Both chips come with eight cores and 16 threads, but the 10700K has higher 3.8 / 5.1 GHz base/boost clocks, while the Core i9-9900K tops out at 3.6 / 5.0 GHz. Both chips have the same 4.7 GHz all-core boost.  The Core i7-10700K gains the extra 100 MHz in boost frequency over the 9900K via Intel's Turbo Boost Max 3.0 tech, which targets the two fastest physical cores (identified during the binning process) and targets them with lightly-threaded applications. The Core i7-10700K doesn't come with a boxed cooler like the competing Ryzen chips, but mid-range air coolers should be sufficient for stock operation, and even some overclocking. Serious overclockers should plan on a 240mm or greater all-in-one cooler, but the overclocking results we'll outline on the following pages are pretty impressive. "

intel-i7-11700K,tomshardware,"The Core i7-11700K uses the same eight-core 16-thread silicon as the Core i9-11900K, but there are a few key differentiators. The 11700K has a lower binning that results in lower peak clock frequencies of 5.0 GHz, a 300 MHz reduction compared to the 11900K, lower peak memory frequencies in low-latency Gear 1 mode (more on that shortly), and culled Thermal Boost Velocity (TVB) and Adaptive Boost Technology (ABT) support. Here's a closer look at the disabled boost tech: Intel only offers ABT on Core i9 K and KF processors, but the basic principle and functionality of the feature should be portable to any Intel chip. That means Intel removed this feature from the 11700K simply to make customers pay more for it by stepping up to its most expensive desktop chips.  Intel lists the Core i7-11700K with a 125W TDP, the same as the previous-gen 10700K, but this only encompasses the PL1 (Power Limit 1) level that occurs when the chip operates at its base frequency. The 11700K jumps to 251W when it operates at boost frequencies (PL2 - Power Limit 2). That's an increase over the 10700K's 224W PL2, but both chips have the same recommended Tau (boost duration) of 56 seconds. As with all other Intel chips, motherboard vendors are free to ignore these limits if their motherboards have adequate power circuitry, so these limits are rarely seen on higher-end boards unless you manually force your motherboard to adhere to them.  Finally, the Core i9-11900K is the only Rocket Lake chip supporting DDR4-3200 memory in the optimal configuration at stock settings, which is called 'Gear 1.'  This setting allows the memory controller and memory frequency to operate at the same speed (1:1), thus providing the lowest latency and best performance in lightly-threaded work, like gaming.    All other Rocket Lake chips, like the Core i7-11700K, only officially support DDR4-3200 with the 'Gear 2' setting, which allows the memory to operate at twice the frequency of the memory controller (2:1) and results in higher data transfer rates. This can benefit some threaded workloads but also results in higher latency that can lead to reduced performance in some applications â particularly gaming. We have yet to see a situation where Gear 2 makes much sense for enthusiasts. Instead, this setting is most useful for those chasing overclocking frequency records that don't directly equate to real-world performance boosts."
intel-i7-12700K,pcmag,"Powered by two new microarchitectures, one designed for maximum performance and one for peak efficiency, Intelâs Alder Lake CPUs have been making some sizable waves in the desktop processor market. Core counts are once again shooting up, and the Core i7-12700K benefits from this and some key architectural improvements to run laps around its ""Rocket Lake"" predecessor. At its $409 price, however, the Core i7-12700Kâs biggest competitor may actually turn out to be its more affordable Core i5 ""K""-series sibling rather than any specific AMD Ryzen 5 or 7 CPU, or Rocket Lake. It's a solid 12th Generation pick on Intel's new platform, and a clear part of Team Blue's desktop-silicon upswing as 2021 draws to a close. Just gauge whether you actually need the extra cores and threads, or the few-at-most extra game frames, before paying the premium over the Core i5-12600K. Before diving into this Core i7 review, we recommend that you first read our Core i9-12900K review if you're new to the 12th Generation Alder Lake family. Intelâs 12th Generation Core architecture is a radical departure from its predecessors. In part, this is due to a number of changes to the platform, like the move to DDR5 RAM, but the most notable difference is the use of two distinctly different microarchitectures inside of the same processor: Performance Cores (P-Cores) and Efficiency Cores (E-Cores). We already covered these new core types in detail in the Core i9 review and wonât go into it all again here; instead, we will focus on what makes the Core i7-12700K its own unique product. The Core i7-12700K encompasses a dozen CPU cores. Most of the chip's performance is derived from eight Hyper-Threaded P-Cores that are built on Intelâs ""Golden Cove"" architecture. Golden Cove is the direct successor to the ""Cypress Cove"" architecture found inside of 11th Generation Rocket Lake processors, and it was designed for high performance. Here, these cores are configured with a base clock of 3.6GHz, but they can hit speeds up to 5.0GHz (in isolated cases under Turbo Boost Max 3.0) or 4.9GHz (under regular turbo boost) right out of the box. The remaining four cores were created with Intelâs ""Gracemont"" architecture, which is a distant descendant of Intelâs low-power Atom processors. As such, the E-Cores were designed with energy efficiency in mind. They are clocked considerably lower, with a base frequency of 2.7GHz and a max turbo of 3.8GHz. Along with the cores, the processor also has 25MB of L3 cache baked in for the cores to share. This model also has Intelâs UHD Graphics 770 integrated graphics processor (IGP), which means you wonât need to buy a graphics card alongside this CPU in a system, unless you want to play games that arenât several years old. Intel rates the chip to have a base power of 125 watts, with a maximum turbo power draw of 190 watts. The nearly identical Intel Core i7-12700KF processor is the same in every detail but lacks the IGP (or rather, likely has the IGP silicon permanently disabled). Its suggested retail price is $20 lower, and this no-graphics variant might be worth checking out if you intend to buy (or already own) a suitable graphics card. One direct impact of Intel introducing high- and low-power core architectures in the same processor is that the company now has a new way to differentiate its range of processors. With Rocket Lake, all of the Core i7 and Core i9 processors were essentially the same thing: eight-core, 16-thread CPUs with the clock speed adjusted accordingly. With Alder Lake, the Core i9-12900K has a more notable advantage over the Core i7-12700K, in that it has four additional cores, a higher clock speed, and an extra 5MB of L3 cache. The impact of this is quite notable in many benchmarks. We tested the Core i7-12700K on an MSI MPG Z690 Carbon WiFi motherboard, with 32GB of Corsair Dominator memory clocked to 4,800MHz, and a 4TB Sabrent Rocket Q4 PCI Express 4.0 boot SSD that also functioned as our game drive. All this was packed in Corsair's iCue 7000D Airflow chassis, fitted with a Corsair iCue H150i Elite Capellix 360mm liquid cooler, and a Corsair 1,000-watt RM1000X power supply.  When looking at the Core i9-12900K and our Core i7-12700K, single-threaded tests place the two CPUs close together as this minimizes the impact made by hardware differences. But most tests that take advantage of all available CPU cores set the Core i9 considerably ahead of the Core i7. The one notable exception is our Adobe Photoshop test results, which showed the Core i7 performing better. But this result is likely due to software updates that were released after our Core i9 review but before this Core i7 review. The Core i9-12900K leading the blue team is to be expected, of course. The performance gains over the last-generation Core i9 and i7 processors is far more notable, as it puts yet another nail in Rocket Lakeâs coffin. Compared with the outgoing 11th Gen Core i9-11900K, Intelâs Core i7-12700K is considerably faster, with Cinebench test scores roughly 69% faster in the multi-core test and 17% faster in the single-core test. The gains over the preceding Core i7 CPU (not charted here, but visible at our Core i7-11700K review) are even more substantial. The results are a bit more mixed comparing the Core i7-12700K to AMDâs top-of-the-line Ryzen 9 5950X, but here too, Intel's 12700K is surprisingly competitive versus that 16-core chip. The Ryzen 9 was faster in the Cinebench R23 multi-core test, but the two CPUs traded blows in most of our other productivity tests. Two exceptions are Handbrake and POV-Ray, but these tests don't appear to run correctly yet on Alder Lake CPUs; it's possible they don't negotiate the new architectures quite right at the moment. (Either that, or the Core i7-12700K performs slower than a 3rd Gen Ryzen 3 or a 10th Gen Core i5, and that is not supported by the other tests.) For the dedicated-graphics tests, we paired the Core i7-12700K with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti card, at Founders Edition clocks, and the Core i7 did not disappoint. In general, you donât get much benefit by going with the Core i9-12900K over the Core i7-12700K for gaming. The Core i7 performed slightly better in Assassinâs Creed: Valhalla than the Core i9 did in Assassin's Creed: Odyssey (the different tests were run because at the i9's launch, Valhalla would not work properly), but the two were within a few frames of each other in most tests, not far enough to anchor any kind of buying decision on. The biggest performance gap occurred when running Rainbow Six Siege at 1080p resolution, but both CPUs were running at over well above 400 frames per second (fps). For a pure gaming build, however, the Core i5-12600K might be a better option over the Core i7-12700K. The performance gap between the two is small in most of our gaming tests, and the Core i5 actually comes out on top in one. AMDâs Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 9 processors all put in a good showing, but the Alder Lake CPUs weâve tested so far all show clear leads (albeit small ones) in most gaming tests with our test discrete card. During the first part of the 2010s, Intelâs integrated graphics technology advanced considerably in a relatively short amount of time. After the 7th Generation (""Kaby Lake"") processors were released, however, the innovation stagnated and the desktop-CPU graphics solutions changed little up until now. With Alder Lake, however, Intel is once again advancing its graphics hardware, and it shows. Compared with the last-gen Intel UHD Graphics 630 in the Core i5-11600K, the Intel UHD Graphics 770 in the Core i7-12700K is roughly 30% faster in the game F1 2021. It also managed to actually run the Assassinâs Creed Valhalla benchmark, which is a notable improvement over the last-generation CPU, as well. Even with these improvements, however, Intel isnât close to matching AMD and its Radeon IGP silicon on the integrated-graphics front. Without a revolutionary improvement in graphics technology or a doubling of resources, Intel remains a clear second to AMD's Ryzen/Radeon G series chips when it comes to IGPs. That said, only a handful of current chips, notably the Ryzen 7 5700G, actually have integrated graphics. Most Ryzen and Athlon CPUs are CPUs only and require a discrete graphics card. And we all know how much of a purchase burden one of those is, these days. Itâs no surprise that Intelâs latest Core i7 processor is faster than its 11th Generation predecessor, but the degree to which performance has increased is rather impressive. The boost in overall core count (thanks to the inclusion of the new E-Cores) made a performance jump a near guarantee, just like we saw with 10th Gen ""Comet Lake"" and 8th Gen ""Coffee Lake."" But Intel's Core i7-12700K has also made notable improvements to single-threaded performance on a scale not seen over the last few generations. Ultimately, whether or not you should buy a Core i7-12700K depends on your budget and system needs. Itâs not quite as powerful as the Core i9-12900K for CPU-intensive tasks, and its performance gains arenât substantial enough purely for gaming to recommend it over the Core i5-12600K. Opting for the Core i5 likely makes more sense for PC gamers, as this will save them a little cash to put into a graphics card...and the way prices on those have been inflated over the last two years, they are going to need it. Like we said in our first two Alder Lake CPU reviews, though, the lower-end chips like the Core i5 will make a lot more sense once motherboards with lower-end chipsets are available. The Z690 boards on the market now are premium models, and many require DDR5 memory, which is at a premium at the moment. You need to factor in the cost of the rest of the platform in an LGA1700 system build here at the end of 2021. (See much more about the Z690 chipset here.) If you have the extra cash to spare, though, and could use the extra multi-threaded muscle, thereâs no harm in opting for the upgrade: The Core i7-12700K does most things very well, apart from keeping its Core i5 brother in his place. The 12th Generation ""Alder Lake"" Core i7-12700K handily outperforms its ""Rocket Lake"" predecessor and stands up to competing AMD CPUs. Its toughest competition is its Core i5 kin.

intel-i7-12700K,tomshardware,"Alder Lake chips support both DDR4 and DDR5 memory, but there are several caveats tied to DDR5. As a default, DDR5 runs in Gear 2 mode, resulting in higher latency. Additionally, standard motherboards only support DDR5-4800 if the motherboard has only two physical slots. Therefore, at stock settings, Alder Lake only supports DDR5-4400 on any motherboard with four slots â even if only two slots are populated. Support drops as low as DDR5-3600 if four slots are filled with dual-rank memory DIMMs. Here are the population rules for DDR5:"
intel-i7-13700K,pcmag,"While status seekers crave the Core i9, Intel's Core i7 processors are often the best values among Team Blue's desktop chips. Though they don't have quite as much multithreaded processing power, Core i7 CPUs pack some serious punch at lower prices than their Core i9 cousins. This often makes them highly recommendable within a given processor generation, and this is exactly where we find ourselves with the Core i7-13700K ($419). While it's not the absolute fastest mainstream desktop chip, and certainly not the cheapest, it occupies a value high point in the silicon marketâone that AMD is struggling to counterâearning it our Editors' Choice award for enthusiast desktop processors. Intel's 13th Generation ""Raptor Lake"" architecture doesn't differ significantly from its 12th Gen ""Alder Lake"" platform. The latter was a revolutionary design with the introduction of a new multicore approach that mixed high-performance P-Cores and high-efficiency E-Cores in a configuration akin to ARM's ""big.Little"" design philosophy. This worked so well for Intel that with Raptor Lake, the company essentially opted for more of the same, boosting the number of cores in the split-level configuration. In other words, we're still looking at Performance cores and Efficient cores; we just have more of them now. The previous-generation Intel Core i7-12700K shipped with eight P-Cores and four E-Cores, while the Core i7-13700K steps up to eight apiece. Intel did change a few more things under the hood with Raptor Lake, boosting the overall amount of cache and pushing clock speeds a bit higher, but the increased core count is by far the most significant difference. That's not to say the increase in clock speed is chopped liver. The Core i7-13700K's Performance cores have a max turbo speed of 5.4GHz, versus 5.0GHz for the Core i7-12700K. The Efficient cores get a similar 400MHz hike, with the E-Cores clocked at 4.2GHz versus 3.8GHz for the Core i7-12700K's. That will certainly help the Core i7-13700K in our upcoming benchmarks, especially the single-threaded tests. It's interesting to note that the new CPU's base clocks are slightly lower than its predecessor's, but realistically this doesn't mean much. Modern processors almost always operate over their base clock speeds when under load, usually running closer to their max turbo speeds. The lower base clocks would only be a factor if the turbo boost functionality was disabled, which would basically defeat the purpose of testing, so it's not something we're going to do. The Core i7-12700K and Core i7-13700K have identical integrated graphics processors (IGPs), denoted as Intel UHD Graphics 770. This graphics solution has 32 execution units (EUs) and operates at 1.5GHz in the Core i7-12700K, with the Core i7-13700K a step higher at 1.6GHz. Raptor Lake processors also support DDR5 RAM speeds up to 5,600MHz, which should give the integrated graphics a boost from the 4,800MHz ceiling of Alder Lake (assuming you pair your chip with appropriately speedy RAM and configure the memory speeds thus). One thing to note: Due to the Intel Core i7-13700K's high power draw (more about that later in the review), it does not come with a stock cooler, air or otherwise; most high-end CPUs these days make you bring your own, too. As our standard 240mm water cooler is unable to handle keeping the Core i7 cool under its thermal limit at full load, it's doubtful any current stock cooler would be sufficient for the task. If you don't have a compatible LGA1700-socket liquid cooler on hand, you'll want to factor that cost into the equation here. That said, competing Ryzen 9 chips like the 7900X and 7950X also require you to supply your own cooler. We tested the Intel Core i7-13700K on a Gigabyte Z790 Aorus Master motherboard with two 16GB sticks of DDR5 memory in a dual-channel configuration. The RAM was operated at the Core i7-13700K CPU's maximum officially supported speed of 5,600MHz. Other non-Raptor Lake CPUs we tested were operated at lower memory speeds according to their respective supported maximums. A 240mm Cooler Master MasterLiquid PL240 Flux water cooler kept the chip from overheating. Power came from a SilverStone DA850 PSU, and all tests were performed under Windows 11. An open-air Praxis Wetbench chassis was used to house all the parts during testing. The Core i7-13700K's price and performance put it in a fiercely competitive group. Arguably its strongest rival is the AMD Ryzen 9 7900 (which we've tested and are in the process of reviewing), which has an MSRP just $10 higher, at $429. However, the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X could equally well claim that position, as it's probably the closest to the Core i7-13700K in overall performance. The older Core i5-12600K, Core i7-12700K, and AMD Ryzen 7 5700X don't threaten the Core i7-13700K's performance, but they're still speedy CPUs worth keeping in mind as they're available at steep discounts now that they're no longer the latest and greatest. The AIDA64 memory and bandwidth test is a useful tool that lets us gauge the amount of bandwidth available to the processor. Though the test scores here aren't directly indicative of real-world performance for any specific applications, the information can help us to understand the other test scores. Memory bandwidth on the Core i7-13700K is plentiful, thanks to the use of DDR5 memory clocked at 5,600MHz. The AMD chips here support DDR5 speeds up to 5,200MHz, but it's notable that the 12th Generation Intel processors limit DDR5 to 4,800MHz and still have more memory bandwidth than AMD. AMD reverses this situation with generally better L2 and L3 cache performance, which is arguably more important. The Core i7-13700K started off impressively in our synthetic benchmarks with Cinebench scores (single-threaded and multithreaded) significantly higher than those of its closest-priced AMD competitor, the Ryzen 9 7900. The 13700K CPU wasn't nearly as fast as AMD's Ryzen 9 7950X in Cinebench multithreaded, but, at $699, the latter costs considerably more. Given that, we'd expect to see the 7950X perform better in every test, but that wasn't quite the case. The Core i7-13700K beat it in single-threaded Cinebench, for one. In our PugetBench-plugin tests using Adobe's popular Photoshop and Premiere Pro, the Core i7-13700K actually traded blows with the Ryzen 9 7950X, winning on one of the two. Typically we'd consider this a draw, but considering their very different prices, the Intel chip is clearly the better value option here. We also saw the Core i7-13700K outpace the Ryzen 9 7950X in our HandBrake and single-threaded POV-Ray tests, though the AMD processor posted countering wins with faster Blender and multi-threaded POV-Ray scores. Overall, the Core i7-13700K didn't outright beat AMD's best Ryzen 9 in terms of performance, but it's crystal clear that it's the better value. It significantly outpaced the similarly priced Ryzen 9 7900 in most tests, with the latter's value equation helped only slightly by the decent stock cooler that AMD ships with it. However, the performance delta was so great that the Ryzen 9 7900 really doesn't compete with the Core i7-13700K. The older Core i7-12700K and the Core i5-13600K are both really more comparable with the Core i7-13700K. And seeing as both have price tags closer to $300, that fact gives you at least a financial incentive to opt for them, even though the Core i7-13700K is clearly faster. Paired with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 GPU, the Core i7-13700K proved one of the best gaming processors we've tested to date. It was notably faster than most of the other tested chips in F1 22 (the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D was quicker at 1080p, but only by an amount within the margin of error). The Core i5-13600K managed to hold its own against the Core i7-13700K, and it and the Ryzen 5 7600 were even slightly better with the resolution turned up to 4K, though the difference was again margin-of-error material. The bottom line is that the Core i7-13700K closely matches or beats out most other mainstream or high-end chips regardless. You'll likely only see slight advantages from chips like the 3D V-cache-enabled AMDs with GPUs higher-end than the already elite RTX 3080. In Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, the Core i7-13700K didn't fare quite as well, falling a few frames behind the older Alder Lake processors as well as (more predictably) the Intel Core i9-13900K and the AMD Ryzen 7 7700. The trend continued with Total War: Three Kingdoms, with the Core i7-13700K once again bested by all the 12th Gen Intel chips and more of the Ryzen 7000 series as well. Again, most of the differences fell within the margin of error, though the Ryzen 9 7950X3D clearly demonstrated its supremacy, finishing 4% ahead of the Core i7-13700K. If you have a very high-end GPU and differences in frame rate of 5% or so are your concern, you may want to look at one of the AMD gaming-focused specialty chips to squeeze out every last drop. The Core i7-13700K did better in Bioshock Infinite, once again coming close to the top of the pack. The Core i9-13900K copped the gold medal here, but the Core i7-13700K was clearly second-best. It was also fastest in Tomb Raider, except at 4K resolution where the Ryzen 9 7950X3D again made its presence known by a few frames. Integrated graphics are often overlooked with processors like these, but they're perfectly well suited for any task apart from running modern games with high levels of graphics detail. The Core i7-13700K's Intel UHD Graphics 770 benefit from slightly higher clock speeds and faster RAM that gives it an edge over older Alder Lake parts, but that's not all that matters when it comes to gaming. In F1 22, the red team headed by the Ryzen 9 7950X3D held a slight advantage, but the Core i7-13700K did finish ahead of all the older Alder Lake chips. This situation changed drastically in Total War: Three Kingdoms, where the Core i7-13700K outpaced everything except the Core i9-13900K. AMD's IGP didn't stand a chance here. The Core i7-13700K's IGP was once again the fastest in Bioshock Infinite, but the older Core i7-12700K and Core i5-12600K took a notable and unexpected lead in Tomb Raider. Those processors' IGP is identical to the new Core i7's except for the latter's slightly higher clocks and faster RAM, which suggests their victory was due to optimization issues. Nonetheless, the Core i7-13700K did beat AMD in all these tests except F1 22. Frame-rate watchers are inclined to view these processors' integrated graphics as unusable for gaming, but it's important to keep in mind that we saw playable frame rates from most of these CPUs in all tests at 720p. Even the AMD chips, which struggle in some games, can run old games like Tomb Raider or Bioshock Infinite if you don't crank resolution or graphics settings too high. Though gaming will undeniably be much better with a discrete GPU, you can still have a relatively enjoyable gaming experience with one of these processors as long as you accept its limitations and stick to games for which it's suited. We test components' power consumption using a Kill-A-Watt wall meter to measure the power draw of the test system as a whole. Since the only component that's changed in these tests is the CPU, the difference in total power consumption is mostly due to that part alone, though comparisons between AMD and Intel must be taken with a grain of salt as we can't test them on the same motherboard. The Core i7-13700K is notably power-hungry, drawing 364 watts (W) of total system power in Cinebench and 544W in Adobe Premiere. That's more than any of the AMD processors and all the Intel competitors except the Core i9-13900K. However, its power draw in Cinebench was only 1 watt more than the Core i7-12700K's, which is superb given the increase in core count. Like most modern high-end processors, the Core i7-13700K hits its thermal limit, in this case 100 degrees C, while under heavy load. This would make overclocking the processor difficult without substantial cooling. Undervolting the chip to reduce heat and help reduce thermal throttling could be beneficial, however. Intel's Core i7-13700K may be power-hungry, but it also delivers thrilling performance for an appropriate price. After looking over the market and comparing its benchmarks to its competitors', the CPU is in a close-to-unassailable position at this moment in the around-$400 zone. You always have the option to spend more and go faster with a Core i9, or to do the opposite of that and buy something more affordable that's a bit slower. Most everyday users would be fine doing the latter, as the Core i5-13600K and older Core i7-12700K offer excellent multithreaded performance, too. But if you're looking to get the best processor you can for around $400, and have factored in the CPU-cooler situation, we can say without hesitation that the Editors' Choice-award-winning Core i7-13700K is it. At $419, Intel's Core i7-13700K is a juggernaut within its price range. Its 16-core design delivers potent multithreaded performance and highly competitive gaming muscle for the money.

intel-i7-13700K,tomshardware,"The Core i7-13700K's performance stems from its 5.4 GHz boost clock, a record for the i7 family, and Intel's addition of four more e-cores, bringing the chip to 16 total cores and 24 threads. Even though Intel still uses the 'Intel 7' process node, it leveraged a newer revision of the silicon to push clock speeds higher while improving power efficiency. Intel also etched the cores on a new, larger die and added additional L3 and L2 cache."
intel-i7-14700KF,pcmag,"Intelâs ""Raptor Lake Refresh"" line of 14th Gen processors has so far been an indifferent lot, but the upswing is here. The new Intel Core i9-14900K and the Intel Core i5-14600K donât introduce much meaningful improvement over their 13th Gen counterparts, making them arguably worse products to buy since they may require BIOS updates on older motherboards to get working. With the new Core i7-14700K, however, we get something different: honest-to-goodness improvements! Better yet, the upgrades come at the same $409 price as its predecessor, making the Intel Core i7-14700K the gem of Intelâs Raptor Lake Refresh lineup. As a Raptor Lake Refresh processor, the Core i7-14700K is not so different from its direct predecessor, the Intel Core i7-13700K. Both of these chips utilize the same processor core and share many of the same specs, but you'll find one primary difference between the two. The Core i7-14700K ships with a total of 20 CPU cores enabled with eight speedy Performance cores (P-cores) and a dozen Efficient cores (E-cores). That's four more E-cores than the 13700K had. This change was a relatively simple one for Intel to make, with little effort needed in terms of design and manufacturing work. All desktop Core i9 and Core i7 processors utilize the same CPU package that, when fully active, has eight P-cores and 16 E-cores for a total of 24 cores. Intel only enables all of these cores in its Core i9 processors, while cores are deactivated on the package to produce a Core i7-branded chip. The cores that Intel disables are likely to be semi-defective and unable to activate, as manufacturing defects do happen and can result in some cores not working correctly. The fact that Intel disabled half of these Efficient cores on the Core i7-13700K could have been due to manufacturing yields or simply to drive some extra distance between the Core i7-13700K and the faster Core i9-13900K. That Intel now has the Core i7-14700K with 12 E-cores active instead of eight could suggest that yields have improved. If fewer cores are failing the quality-control checks, then it would be easier for Intel to create a large number of Core i7 chips with these many cores active. Either that, or Team Blue simply doesnât see the need to keep as much distance between the Core i7 and Core i9 any longer in this generation. Whatever the reason, itâs exciting news for you if youâre buying a Core i7, as it means youâll see a touch more performance and without any added cost. The clock speed has also been increased slightly, from a max boost clock of 5.4GHz on the 13700K to 5.6GHz on the 14700K. This isnât going to make much of a difference broadly, but it might in some specific scenarios like a single-threaded benchmark or a lightly threaded application. The L3 and L2 cache pools have also been increased slightly, by 3MB and and 4MB, respectively, thanks to the added E-cores. The max officially supported memory speed remains unchanged at 5,600MHz, and so does the Intel UHD Graphics 770 integrated graphics processor (IGP). The IGP has 32 execution units (EUs) and is clocked at 1.6GHz on both the Core i7-13700K and Core i7-14700K. I paired the Core i7-14700K with a Gigabyte Z780 Aorus Master motherboard and 32GB of DDR5 RAM clocked at the processorâs max official memory speed of 5,600MHz for testing purposes. The processor was actively cooled during the benchmarking process by a Cooler Master MasterLiquid PL240 Flux water cooler. The system is also equipped with a 1TB NVMe PCIe 4.0 SSD and a SilverStone DA850 850-watt power supplyâall built into a Praxis Wetbench chassis. All tests were performed inside of Windows 11 with all of the most recent Windows updates installed. The graphics card used during the testing process was the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080. The Core i7-14700K should be able to support a faster graphics card than this without issue, but according to Steamâs hardware survey, most gamers are using significantly older cards. By using the RTX 3080, we are able to determine the benefit, if any, in having such a fast processor with a GPU of this caliber compared with the other processors tested. The GeForce RTX 3080 was also used for all CPU benchmarks and was removed from the system only while testing the IGP. We saw some minor improvements in the 14700Kâs memory and cache bandwidth over the 13700K. Its increased clock speed helped it to transfer data to and from RAM slightly faster than even the Core i9-14900K in one event, and it also helped in cache performance, trading blows with the AMD Ryzen 7 7700X. The 14700K gained an even bigger jump in the cache performance area from its additional cores, though. This came with additional cache, and the test includes the performance of all the cores accessing cache, leading to a fairly significant increase in some areas and not much change in others. L1 write, for example, was a bit slower but L1 read was much higher. Itâs in the CPU-muscle tests that we really start to see the benefits of those extra cores. In Cinebench, the added cores and cache resulted in an 18% increase in multi-threaded performance. This result is a bit of an outlier, though, as most results were lower, with single-threaded performance in Cinebench increasing by a more modest 4.5%, thanks to the boosted clock speed. We saw lesser results in the two Adobe tests we run, with essentially the same numbers on the Core i7-13700K and the Core i7-14700K. HandBrake showed slightly better results, with a 5% performance improvement, while Blender showed an even greater performance bump of 11% above the 13700K. POV-Ray ended things on a mixed note, with a statistically irrelevant difference in the single-threaded test but a modest 8% improvement in the multi-threaded test. Iâll hold off breaking down a blow-by-blow comparison with the competing AMD chips, but suffice it to say that the Core i7-14700K performed well here. Its main competitor should have been the AMD Ryzen 7 7700X, but in truth the 7700X didn't come close to matching the 14700K in a head-on competition. Even in single-threaded scenarios that gave the 7700X the best possible chance to catch the 14700K (like in Cinebench), the 14700K was 8% faster. The three Ryzen 9 processors we have in the charts came closer to delivering viable competition against the Core i7-14700K, with the Ryzen 9 7950X and the Ryzen 9 7950X3D driving better performance in several tests. The Ryzen 9 7900X wasnât able to pass the 14700K in any of the benchmarks, but it came much closer than the Ryzen 7 7700X, and the 7900X tied the 14700K in a few places. Only the 7900X is similar in price to the 14700K, though; the other two Ryzen chips are well more expensive, in the mid-$500s and mid-$600s, respectively, at this writing. Our use of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 results in less variation when testing high-end CPUs, as most are able to draw peak performance out of the graphics card. In 3DMarkâs Time Spy test, the Core i7-14700K was able to set a new record for us, though, with a score higher than even the Core i9-14900K. This excellent performance in 3DMark sadly doesnât carry over to dominance with in-game benchmarks. In most tests, the 14700K turned in overall average results, with the most notable difference being a drop in performance in Total War Three Kingdoms. This was surprising, as the 14700K fell behind all of the other processors we tested including the aged AMD Ryzen 7 5700X. Given all of the other Intel processors big and small did better in this test, it seems likely something was throwing the results off slightly for the 14700K, but the result was repeatable. It could simply be that the processor was mistakenly using its E-cores too much instead of its P-cores in this specific game causing the change, but that's speculation. With all of the Intel processors in our test line up coming equipped with the Intel UHD Graphics 770, we again see results with little deviation. The same occurs on the AMD side of things, with all of those chips using the same IGP as well, except for the Ryzen 7 5700X, which doesnât have an IGP. Performance as usual isnât terrible for an integrated graphics solution, with all of the games we tested being playable at least at 720p resolution and some at 1080p. You wouldnât want to run the latest AAA titles with these IGPsâthatâs for sureâbut with some older titles (or with bottomed-out graphics settings) you can scrape by with an enjoyable enough experience. Using a Kill-A-Watt meter, we measured the power draw of the test systems during select tests to roughly gauge overall power consumption. It should come as little surprise, but the Core i7-14700K draws a fair bit more power than the 13700K, and it comes close to matching the two Core i9s. Adding extra cores and cranking up the clock speed will do that to a chip, but we doubt many will care about a few extra watts being pulled if it means better performance, and it does. Heat was a deeply felt problem for the 14700K, though, as the processor hit its thermal limit while under heavy load and then thermal-throttled the clock speed back. You might have better luck with a triple-fan 360mm water cooler, but if this happened in our open-air test bed with a 240mm water cooler, then we donât have high hopes for keeping it cool inside of a traditional case. Intelâs line of Raptor Lake Refresh processors has been a bit of a letdown with the Core i5 and i9 parts, but the Intel Core i7-14700K is an exception with legitimate improvements. Unlike the Core i5-14600K and the Core i9-14900K that had insignificant clock speed bumps with no real impact on performance, the Core i7-14700K makes a much more significant statement with its four additional cores. The improvements arenât enormous in most cases and a bit less than we would hope for from a new architecture, but they are right in line with what we would like to see from a refreshed processor line: a modest but notable improvement without a price hike or a need to buy a new platform. Itâs with the Core i7-14700K that Intel finally got the Raptor Lake Refresh right. Naturally, if you are on an older system with anything dated further back than an Intel 12th Gen processor, then upgrading to the likes of the Core i7-14700K would net you a huge performance boost. (It'll also require a new motherboard, of course.) If you are just gaming and have an 11th Gen Intel processor or perhaps a later AM4 processor like the Ryzen 7 5700X, you may want to consider holding off a bit longer. Those can still do well enough in those tasks, and we will likely see much more significant performance improvements than we are seeing here with the following generation. From a non-gaming standpoint and considering overall processor performance, however, upgrading now could easily be justifiable by the amount of added performance you will gain in various workloads. As for upgrading a current LGA 1700 system, we could see the Core i7-14700K as a smart upgrade option if you currently have any 12th Gen or 13th Gen Core i3 processors, or possibly from a 12th Gen Core i5 like the Intel Core i5-12600K. Again, purely for gaming, this isnât much of an upgrade, as the 12600K is still an excellent gaming processor. However, those extra i7-14700K cores come in handy while multitasking, working in Photoshop, and rendering media tasks. If youâre running anything better than a 12th Gen Intel Core i5, then sit it out and wait for the next line of Intel chips to arrive. The Core i7-14700K is the best value of Intel's refreshed ""Raptor Lake"" CPUs, bringing marked improvements at no extra cost. It's an attractive upgrade for older LGA 1700 systems.

intel-i7-14700KF,tomshardware,"The highlight is the Core i7-14700K's clock speed, which reportedly reached a maximum frequency of 5.985 GHz during the test. The extremely high clock speed matches that of the Core i9-13900KS, which is the only Intel CPU to date that packs a turbo frequency of 6 GHz without the aid of overclocking. Having additional frequency headroom would be very useful for Intel's upcoming 14th Gen Raptor Lake Refresh parts, which are reportedly getting a price hike over Raptor Lake. Intel's new parts will need to be noticeably quicker if it wants its 14th-gen chips to entice buyers. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox."
intel-i9-10900K,pcmag,"As 2020 draws to a close, we're taking a look at two of the biggest desktop CPU launches of the year to see how they stack up side by side. Intel's top-end mainstream-platform CPU for desktops, the Core i9-10900K, may not have all the leading-edge feature glory and new architecture of the new(er) AMD Ryzen 9 5900X. But does that technical debt translate into less performance in the places where it counts the most? Just in case the Editors' Choice award above for the Ryzen 9 5900X didn't already tip you off, the brass ring this time will go with the Red Team rather than the Blue Team. That said, let's dig into the features, price, and performance of these two flagship options to see which company is producing the best high-powered processors in the market today. To start off our comparison between these two top-end chips, let's take a peek at some base specs... As you can see above, there's already a bit of a problem trying to put these two head-to-head: the nearly-$500 10-core Intel Core i9-10900K seems to be missing two cores...or the $549 12-core AMD Ryzen 9 5900X brought two extra cores to the party, depending on how you want to look at it. But on pricing, while $488 might sound reasonable enough given the Core i9-10900K's two-core deficit, the street price of the Core i9-10900K is, just about everywhere you can find it, anywhere between $549 and $599. (And that's if it's even in stock in the first place.) This puts it right in the crosshairs of the $549 AMD Ryzen 9 5900X on price, but that's where the similarities end. The 10-core Intel Core i9-10900K, like five years of desktop processor releases before it, is based on a 14nm lithography process, now aged up to what's been dubbed here in 2020 a ""14nm++"" process. The company continues to use a monolithic die approach to its architecture, and although the 14nm process is more than five years old at this point, Intel's engineers have proven it to be a solid foundation for constant iteration and subtle improvement over time. Meanwhile, like the preceding generation of Ryzen chips, the new Zen 3-based Ryzens are based on the company's 7nm lithography. They continue to use a multi-die ""chiplet"" approach, which helps to increase the yields of its production process. This gives AMD the ability to throw more cores into the chip package at a competitive price, keeping the cost-per-core ratio between the 5900X and 10900K a Ryzen advantage out of Intel's reach. The Ryzen 9 5900X features 64MB of available L3 cache to the Core i9-10900K's 20MB, and a TDP of 105 watts to the Core i9-10900K's 125-watt requirement. Which brings us to a quick sidebar about the platform. WINNER: AMD Ryzen 9 5900X, in per-core value The short version of these two foundational topics? AMD: One socket, Socket AM4, that works (with some recent caveats) with three generations of CPUs (and counting). Intel: Never more than two generations of Core chips per socket before a new socket and motherboards show up. AMD continues to do everything it can to grandfather as many motherboards as possible into the Ryzen 5000 Series ecosystem, while Intel has stuck to its usual pattern: a move from 9th Generation Core's LGA1151 to a new, incompatible LGA1200 socket for the 10th Generation ""Comet Lake-H"" CPUs, of which the Core i9-10900K is the family head. Also, the top-end chipset for 10th Generation Core processors, Z490, comes on boards that don't even have support for PCI Express 4.0 (yet). Granted, they could be forgiven, since PCIe 4.0 doesn't make much difference (yet!) in overall system performance numbers, outside of peak storage-benchmark speeds with cutting-edge SSDs, but there's the future-proofing aspect to think of. By contrast, the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X works on any AM4-based motherboard between the X570 and B350 platforms. We recommend checking with your manufacturer for proper BIOS support before picking up a Ryzen 9 5900X sight unseen, though. But you might be able to drop one into an older, existing motherboard, whereas with a 10th Generation Intel CPU like the Core i9-10900K, you'll need a board with the new LGA1200 socket. Finally, PCI Express 4.0 is standard issue for all motherboards based on B450, B550, or X570 chipsets. Point and round, to AMD. It's not all sour grapes for Intel, though. The company maintains its lead on single-core boost clock speeds, at just over half a gigahertz faster between the two processors. As you're about to see, though, that spec lead doesn't always translate to a guarantee of wins once we fire up the benchmarks. WINNER: AMD Ryzen 9 5900X, in platform longevity and compatibility So, the Ryzen 9 5900X walks into our performance benchmark arena with a two-core advantage and a roughly equal footing in street price. How does it shake out in content creation and productivity benchmarks? Let's take a look... As we discussed at greater length in our deep-dive review of the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X, AMD's chip outright beat Intel at all of our standard benchmark tasks. Heavily multithreaded runs that scale well with more cores applied, like 7-Zip, continue to be blowouts for AMD, with the Ryzen 9 achieving a result that was 85% faster in that compression/decompression test. That's a record showing for this class of chip, and a win that's no doubt aided by the Ryzen 9 5900X's core advantage over the Core i9-10900K. Gains in Cinebench were less drastic, by comparison, but still significant. The Ryzen 9 5900X was roughly 40% faster than the Core i9-10900K in the multi-core run, if just 5% faster in single-core. This is still impressive, though, considering that the 5900X has to make room for two more cores than the Core i9-10900K and still manages to outpace it in single-core content work. (That was also borne out in the single-core run of POV-Ray and the minimally threaded legacy iTunes test.) Single-core speed has long been a traditional strength for Intel chips versus their like-priced and similarly positioned AMD competitors. This Ryzen 9 breaks that norm. Given the price, taken together, of the chip and the mandatory adoption of LGA1200, the Intel Core i9-10900K isn't a better deal than the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X for pure productivity, like the tasks reflected here. The Ryzen 9 5900X should be at the top of the list for content creators who need to squeeze every drop of performance out of their machines in a prosumer or a professional work environment with thread-happy software. WINNER: AMD Ryzen 9 5900X, as a productivity- and creative-performance leader Gaming performance has also been a traditional strength of Intel's desktop CPUs, in games at resolutions where CPU performance comes into play as the limiting factor. And for a while there, Intel hung on. Through the various ""Lake"" generations of processor starting with ""Skylake,"" up against its successive AMD Ryzen challengers, Intel would sustain its lead in the one area that drives lots of sales of desktop processors among PC upgraders and builders: PC gaming. Welp, scratch another one off the list... Though the race is closer on gaming than it is on productivity, in lightly threaded frame-rate record-setters like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, the Ryzen 9 5900X gives our sample GPU (the still very high-end GeForce RTX 2080 Ti) the room it needs to sail to new heights at 4K by 30fps over the Intel Core i9-10900K, and at 1080p by 75fps. That 1080p result of 679fps won't be relevant to serious gamers for at least a few more years (1,000Hz gaming monitors here we come!), but these wins were consistent across our testing in 3DMark scores and another high-refresh-capable blockbuster, Rainbow Six: Siege. However, the Core i9-10900K and its 5.3GHz boost clock shows up to the party once more engines and thread loads are thrown into the mix. The Core i9-10900K walks away with comfortable wins in Far Cry 5 and Bioshock: Infinite, and a photo-finish win in our benchmark of Tomb Raider (2013). Between the two, it comes down to what types of games you intend to play. However, between these two choices and a lower-end CPU on the same platforms (say, an Intel Core i5-10600K or an AMD Ryzen 3 3300X), it comes down to the resolution you plan to play at. Both the Core i9-10900K and the Ryzen 9 5900X qualify as overkill for most games played at resolutions above 1080p, so if you've got either a 1440p or 4K display, you'd be better served spending less on your CPU and shifting the rest of that budget into a beefier graphics card instead...assuming ""money"" is a finite thing for you. WINNER: A draw, dependent on game and resolution As two top-end chips that come close to maximizing the potential of their respective platforms, it's not a surprise that both the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X and the Intel Core i9-10900K have limited amounts of room available for overclockers to play in. In our testing, we found that Intel has stretched 14nm to its limits. Thermal tests showed the Core i9-10900K peak at 79 degrees C (versus the Ryzen 9 5900X's 71 degrees C), but the chip takes back a win when you look at the overclocking potential. Though both chips were overclockable to a point of stability above their stock specsâby nearly 15% in the case of the Ryzen 9 5900Xâonly the Core i9-10900K returned verifiably improved performance (of around 5%) on actual testing scores. The effect of our overclocking on the Ryzen 9 5900X returned either identical results, or results that fell under the line set by the original non-overclocked benchmarks. On the software side, Intel users can download the company's Extreme Tuning Utility (XTU) tool, which features real-time control of nearly every aspect of how the Core i9-10900K behaves, while AMD's Ryzen Master utility fills a similar role for Ryzen 9 5900X owners. On this front, it's even, as each piece of software is as deeply feature-rich as the other, including internal benchmarking tools, thermal monitoring, and the option to both save and import custom profiles directly in the panel. WINNER: A draw: AMD for thermals, but Intel for overclocking performance By now, it's no secret that AMD has utilized its close relationship with chip manufacturing giant TSMC to the fullest with the release of the Ryzen 5000 Series. The Ryzen 9 5900X is the company's best foot put forward against Intel's Core i9-10900K. The Ryzen 9 5900X runs at less power, and has 20% more cores than the Core i9-10900K for close to the same real-world price. It's compatible with multiple generations of AM4 motherboards, and it universally outpaces the Core i9-10900K in content-creation tasks while trading blows with it in gaming (with ties, win, and losses alike, depending on the engine). Intel's not out of the race yet, though, with its fourth straight desktop-CPU release on 14nm, dubbed ""Rocket Lake,"" set to debut in the first quarter of 2021. If the company can squeeze some final gains out of its 14nm++(++?) architecture, there's a chance it could either catch up to, or perhaps edge past, Zen 3-based processors sooner rather than later. Until then, though, for between $500 to $600, the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X is the best premium desktop processor you can get for productivity, content creation, and lightly threaded gaming at all resolutions.

intel-i9-10900K,tomshardware,"Once again, Intel aims its flagship chip squarely at enthusiasts and power users, touting the Core i9-10900K as the fastest gaming processor in the world. That performance comes mostly via the processor's extra cores and the fact that it basically comes pre-overclocked to an all-core 4.9 GHz, not to mention the peak 5.3 GHz speeds.   Intel's Core i9-10900K still doesn't match AMD's halo 16-core 32-thread Ryzen 9 3950X in terms of threaded performance. Instead, the 10900K competes with the 12-core 24-thread Ryzen 9 3900X in terms of both performance and price, but Intel's chip has the highest power consumption we've seen recently on the mainstream desktop. Intel pushes the 10900K's TDP envelope up to 125W (a 30W gen-on-gen increase), but that's only a measure of base power consumption. Intel rates the processor for 250W at peak performance, and we even measured peaks as high as 325W at out-of-the-box settings. Naturally, that results in a lot of heat.  Intel does have a few tricks to deal with the resulting heat and improve overclocking, like thinning the die and using a thicker heat spreader, but cooling is still a significant challenge. The 10900K's high power consumption even overwhelmed our 280mm watercooler during some tasks, so you'll need a brawny cooler to handle the increased heat output.  Intel also added a few new features to its halo product to satiate enthusiasts, like per-core hyper-threading adjustments and reworked overclocking software, among other new tunable knobs. However, because the Core i9-10900K is basically an overclocked processor right out of the box, there is precious little overclocking headroom with conventional cooling. However, provided you have adequate cooling, the Core i9-10900K is unquestionably the fastest gaming processor on the market. It also offers incredibly snappy performance in lightly-threaded apps, and solid performance in heavily-threaded workloads. Despite its insatiable power consumption and high heat output, the 10900K will be sure to find some uptake from performance enthusiasts that are prepared to splurge on a robust motherboard, power supply, and cooler, but most users would be better served with cheaper AMD alternatives, like the Ryzen 9 3900X.  For the Core i9-10900K, Intel essentially stretched out its existing 14nm++ die and the Skylake architecture's ring bus interconnect. The integrated UHD Graphics 630 engine remains unchanged and is available on all models, but you also have the option to buy graphics-less F-series variants to save some cash (you can shave off $16 the Core i9-10900KF).  The real story comes in the form of higher clock rates, extra cores, more performance, and all of the power consumption pain that entails. Intel has brought support for its Turbo Boost Max 3.0 technology from the high end desktop to its mainstream platforms, and also roped in its Thermal Velocity Boost (TVB) mechanism from its mobile chips. This creates a multi-tiered boost implementation that can be incredibly confusing, so here is a short summation of each boost and what it entails: The Core i9-10900K's ten cores and 20 threads operate at a 3.7 GHz base frequency when all cores are loaded, but that can improve to 4.8 GHz via the normal Turbo Boost, and up to 4.9 GHz via Intel's Thermal Velocity Boost (TVB) feature. TVB is yet another layer to Intel's boost mechanism, but according to Intel, it only engages if the processor remains below 70C. However, we found that the all-core TVB frequency routinely engages regardless of chip temperature, which means motherboard vendors are still free to largely ignore Intel's power recommendations (functionality will vary by board). These vastly improved all-core boosts give the 10-core 10900K a fighting chance to match the 3900X's twelve cores in threaded applications, but as we'll see, that comes with a heavy power burden.  TVB also applies to single-core boosts, too. Intel touts a 5.3 GHz single-core boost if the chip remains under 70C and meets all of the other normal requirements for boost activity. The chip downshifts to a dual-core 5.2 GHz via Turbo Boost Max 3.0 if the workload spreads across two cores, and then falls to 5.1 GHz if the workload lands in a single 'normal' core. Intel's goal is to provide the utmost in single-core performance, which remains its key advantage against AMD's Ryzen processors in lightly-threaded tasks like gaming and standard desktop PC applications. All of this means that, given appropriate cooling and power delivery, you can hit 5.3 GHz in lightly-threaded work and up to 4.9 GHz in demanding all-core workloads. Intel assigned the 10900K a 125W TDP envelope, but that only applies when the chip operates at its base frequency - remember, Intel doesn't guarantee that you'll ever see Turbo Boost frequencies during normal operation. The chip is free to jump to 250W during boost activity, and motherboard vendors can ignore those limits. Unlike the competing Ryzen 9 3900X, the Core i9-1900K doesn't come with a cooler, but at least the requisite motherboards are compatible with existing 115x coolers. Surprisingly, Intel only recommends a cooler that meets the PCG 2015D specification, meaning a cheap cooler that comes as either a 120mm AIO or a standard heat sink and fan, both of which can only dissipate 130W of waste heat. While this may technically meet Intel's specification for the base TDP rating, you would likely would see little to no Turbo Boost activity with a cooler of that class.  We tested with the beefier Noctua NH-D15 and could mostly satisfy cooling requirements in standard desktop PC applications, but you will lose out on performance in workloads that push the boundaries with AVX instructions. As such, you'll need a greater-than-280mm AIO cooler or a custom loop to unlock the best of the 10900K. You'll also need an enthusiast-class motherboard with beefy power circuitry, and also plan on some form of active cooling for the motherboard's power delivery subsystem.  Intel's Core i9-10900K comes with a few other tweaks, like improved memory support that jumps from DDR4-2666 to DDR4-2933, but still lags AMD's standard DDR4-3200 support. Intel also increased the L3 cache to 20MB. As before, Intel supports the PCIe 3.0 interface, while AMD has long since moved on to PCIe 4.0 and its doubled bandwidth.  You'll need to upgrade to an LGA1200 motherboard for the new Comet Lake chips, and many Z490 models do support the PCIe 4.0 interface, albeit at the cost of increased pricing. However, that feature exists for as-yet-officially-unnamed future chips (read; Rocket Lake), so you'll pay extra for flagship motherboards that come with a feature you won't be able to use unless you upgrade your processor in the future.   "
intel-i9-11900K,pcmag,"Is Intel's new $539 Core i9-11900K desktop CPU made of silicon? Yes, of course it is. Does that mean, by extension here in 2021, it might end up tricky to find at Intel's recommended pricing? Very possible. The demand for high-end component hardware is practically baked in these days. So the Core i9-11900K, Intel's latest flagship processor and the head of its 11th Generation ""Rocket Lake"" line, should sell well. But it is not the rabbit that the chip giant needs to pull out of its hat after a few years spent trailing AMD in CPU innovation and raw performance. It's merely a pedestrian showing at a time when real magic is necessary to change the CPU conversation. The Core i9-11900K, while impressive in single-threaded tasks, in our early tests ran too hot, too power-hungry, and not stable enough under stress to remain competitive with AMD's Ryzen desktop-CPU offerings, or even Intel's own previous-generation CPUs, such as the 10th Generation Core flagship, the Core i9-10900K. The eight-core, slightly cheaper AMD Ryzen 7 5800X proves to be stiff competition for Intel on both single-core and multicore tasks, while the cheaper Intel Core i7-11700K, also with eight cores, rivaled our test sample when benchmarked in a similarly configured prebuilt MSI desktop. The slightly better single-core boost under specific thermal scenarios, which is exclusive to the Core i9-11900K, won't be enough to sell most buyers on this chip versus other options on the market with the same core count, though this dynamic could shift more in the Core i9's direction as Z590 motherboards gain more stability with it over the next few weeks and months. Even on paper and in pure specs, the Intel Core i9-11900K shows a bit of an off-kilter loadout and a regression in a key area: core and thread count. Check out these specs and see if you can spot what we're talking about... Notice anything missing versus the Core i9-10900K? Like, say, two cores? No, you don't need to get your eyes checked; Intel indeed has removed two cores from its top-end chip in the consumer Core i9 line, versus the Core i9-10900K. The company added two when it went from the 9th Generation flagship Core i9-9900K (and Core i9-9900KS) to the Core i9-10900K. The fab giveth, and the fab taketh away. According to Intel, its engineers found that eight cores is the ""sweet spot"" for most enthusiasts who use Intel's high-end desktop CPUs. That's even in the face of the 12-core/24-thread Ryzen 9 5900X ($549.99 MSRP), which has been hard to find on every major retailer's website since it launched last November. That list price may be questionable, as the chip has largely been made of unobtanium since launch, but a theoretically like-priced chip with a massive 50% more cores is hard to ignore. There is some merit to Intel's decision to cap the Core i9-11900K at eight cores. At this point in the desktop CPU game, most PC enthusiasts buying an Intel desktop CPU at this level will fall into the camp of ""gamers eager to squeeze out every frame,"" versus that of ""pro content creators who need every core they can get."" The creator crowd has been seized tight by AMD's Ryzens at the moment, so it makes sense why Intel is comfortable being more conservative with its core count in the Core i9-11900K. Games can absorb benefits from only so many cores (six tends to be the max, even for AI-heavy tasks like computing turns in Civilization VI), and the Rocket Lake line is still built on another refined version of Intel's long-running 14nm process technology, as opposed to AMD's 7nm process used in its late-model Ryzens. Something had to give to get another generation out of it. Keeping the chip to just eight cores allows for more thermal wiggle room. and by extension also enables Intel to hit higher single-threaded boost speeds, with the Core i9-11900K rated for a 3.5GHz base clock and a 5.3GHz boost clock. Note: This boost clock is only on a single, predetermined core, and it will activate at that boost speed once the parameters for an increasingly convoluted core-acceleration strategy from Intel are met. ""Convoluted,"" indeed may be an understatement when talking about high-end Intel chips' thermal and clock-speed management systems. Let's talk about Intel's core-accelerating TurboBoost and its several additional flavors. This time around, Intel has branded its latest on-board boost technology for its Core i9 line as Adaptive Boost Technology (ABT), not to be confused with the Thermal Velocity Boost (TVB) technology found in some 10th Generation Core ""Comet Lake"" chips. And that itself should not be confused with TurboBoost Max 3.0. For TVB, the board ""opportunistically and automatically increases clock frequency above single-core and multi-core Intel Turbo Boost Technology frequencies based on how much the processor is operating below its maximum temperature and whether turbo power budget is available."" That frequency gain, as well as the duration of the gain, is dependent on the workload, the capabilities of the processor, and the processor cooling solution. Confused? Take a look at Intel's illustration below to get a clearer picture of what we're talking about... Yeah, it's a lot to grok. Adaptive Boost Technology is rather esoteric stuff. It activates when, and I quote: ""When in a turbo mode, if three or more cores are active, the processor will attempt to provide the best frequency within the power budget, regardless of the TB2 frequency table. The limit of this frequency is given by TB2 in two-core mode. ABT overrides TVB when three or more cores are active."" If you didn't catch all that on the first pass, don't worry about it. We're not even sure Intel actually expects you to. Intel's push to get as much juice out of its 14nm lithography (now built on its latest ""Cypress Cove"" microarchitecture, backported from the 10nm ""Sunny Cove"" first seen in its ""Tiger Lake"" mobile chips) has led us here, where nearly every possible power state of the CPU also comes with a type of boost attached and everything is being optimized to the nth degree. In so many words, in the case of high-end Rocket Lake chips, this means the processor will apply an extra boost to the two highest-quality cores on the chip when it detects that the chip is within an Intel-predetermined thermal limit of safety to do so. And in even fewer words? ""Chips go faster in tasks that tax one or two cores, and AMD's Precision Boost 2 already did it in 2018."" So, enough with the iterative stuff, let's move on to the bigger changes around Rocket Lake. A major upgrade for Intel this time around is on the side of integrated graphics. The Intel Core i9-11900K comes with the company's new Iris Xe UHD Graphics 750 silicon. Though we didn't run any benchmarks on the integrated graphics processor (IGP) of the Core i9-11900K (partly because of time constraints, but mainly because few buyers will shop for this chip and not pair it with a graphics card), we recommend hopping over to our review of the Core i5-11600K to see just how much of an improvement gamers can expect. (Spoiler: It doubles many of the results we saw on UHD Graphics 630, but it still trails the AMD Ryzen 5 3400G in peak frame rates.) For those looking for an IGP that can just drive a display, however, the Iris Xe UHD 750 will support one 4K (4,096-by-2,303-pixel) display up to 60Hz, or up to three displays in total at lower resolutions. Here's a look at the full Rocket Lake stack, with the Core i9-11900K at the top... We left off Intel's ""T""-class Rocket Lake chips, low-power-consumption models mainly of interest to system OEMs. As you can see, as in the previous generation. Intel is also offering non-""K"" versions of the various 11th Generation chips (without unlocked modifiers for overclocking), as well as slightly cheaper (in theory!) ""F"" variants with the integrated graphics silicon disabled. If you don't plan to overclock, and do plan to use a video card, it's possible to save some bucks going with a ""K,"" ""F,"" or ""KF"" variant. Readers might notice the lack of 11th Generation Core i3 chips this time around, but budget-minded users won't be left in the cold. Though we're here to talk about 11th Generation/Rocket Lake today, 10th Generation Comet Lake desktop isn't done just yet, making a reappearance this time in what is dubbed the ""Comet Lake Refresh"" family... There isn't a whole lot on offer here, aside from a 100MHz bump to the base and boost clock of all Core i3 models in the stack, along with compatibility with Z590, H570, and B560 motherboards. But the distinction here is that the Comet Lake Refresh chips are based on the same lithography and architecture as Comet Lake, while Rocket Lake employs some new aspects in both areas. Next is platform compatibility. While Rocket Lake remains compatible with the LGA 1200 socket first introduced with Intel's 10th Generation/Comet Lake platform, it introduces a new Z590 chipset (and lower-cost, lesser-featured 500-series chipsets) into the mix for the ultra-enthusiast who wants to stay at or just over that mystical ""bleeding edge."" That said, 11th Generation Rocket Lake chips will be compatible with select Z490 boards, as well. However, the number of Rocket Lake CPUs that will work is limited, as is the number of boards that will support them. (Check with the motherboard manufacturer on the compatibility and BIOS status before you buy, if you're looking to drop a Rocket Lake chip into a 400-series motherboard.) Now, if Z590 were based on a different socket from Z490, or sported technical or feature upgrades from Intel's last generation of chips, a full chipset refresh like this would be understandable. But there simply isn't a whole host of significant changes on offer here. The benefits of upgrading from Z490 to Z590 include more PCI Express lanes (eight, to be exact) and native support for PCI Express 4.0. (Some Z490 boards were advertised as ""PCI Express 4.0 ready"" and will need support for the feature patched in via the BIOS.) Also new with the Z590 chipset: potentially faster USB connectivity with support for Gen 3.2 Gen 2x2, as well as native support for four more USB Gen 3.2 Gen 2 ports than Z490 (now up to 10, versus up to six). Finally, Z590 motherboards will support the option for Wi-Fi 6E. (Read more about that upgrade in our explainer here.) But that's about it. If those minimal gains in specific areas don't mean much to you, a Z490 board with a 10th Generation Intel chip might well run cheaper than a full upgrade to 11th Generation and Z590. Note that Intel will also support Rocket Lake in boards built off the H470 chipset, but that's where last-gen-chipset support will end. Speaking of which... This review process, like with the Core i9-10900K review last year, did not go off without a hitch. Though it's now an open secret because of the early sales of the Core i7-11700K, up to today's review embargo date, reviewers (that includes myself, colleagues I've spoken to, and some usual-suspect members of the review network across the web) have noted some issues with the motherboards that were either sent directly by Intel or purchased when they went on sale early last month. In PCMag's case, the Asus ROG Maximus XIII Hero we received as a part of the press kit took hours of troubleshooting just to get it to a point where it would post in the BIOS after the system was built. From there, another handful of hours were tacked on to get our Windows 10 test environment to stay alive for more than 25 seconds.  After much tweaking, and a process of elimination longer than my arm, I was finally able to get the motherboard to post using a brand-new beta BIOS (version 0620, published March 23, 2021, for any eventual Hero owners out there). Once we were booting into the OS, this was just the start of our issues. Sure, we were now in Windows 10, but getting the CPU to stay stable in heavy gaming or CPU tests took further tweaks and iterations. We started our testing with the same settings we've used in previous reviews of Intel CPUs (these include everything from the Core i3-10100 all the way up to the Core i9-10900K), as well as the same XMP II performance profile on our motherboard that we've used to bench all graphics cards released over the past 10 months with the 10th Generation Core i9-10900K. This profile would consistently crash on the Core i9-11900K; however, the Intel Core i5-11600K, as well as the Core i9-10900K, both powered through the benchmarks on the standard XMP II profile without issue. Ultimately, our testbed would push through our Core i9-11900K benchmarks only if the memory was running at just 3,000MHz (the G.Skill TridentZ sticks we use are rated for up to 3,600MHz), SVID Behavior was tuned all the way down to Intel's recommended Fail Safe profile, and every case fan, radiator fan, and pump was cranked to the fastest profile available on the board. The Intel Core i9-11900K, like the Core i9-10900K and many other Core i9 and unlocked ""K"" versions of Intel chips before it, comes with no bundled cooler in the box. This is likely because, to run the chip, Intel recommends at least a 240mm liquid-cooled radiator to keep your processor below ideal temperatures. So you'll need to supply your own cooler at added expense, and suited to the case you'll mount it in. For what it's worth, AMD also recommends that you use a liquid cooler on its top-end chips like the Ryzen 9 5900X and the Ryzen 9 5950X. However, competing eight-core alternatives to the Core i9-11900K, such as the Ryzen 7 5800X, are efficient enough to run stable on a powerful air cooler at stock settings, if need be. We tested the Core i9-11900K on an Asus ROG Maximus XIII Hero (Wi-Fi) Z590 motherboard, with 16GB of G.Skill memory clocked to 3,000MHz (for comparability with our earlier CPU reviews), and a Mushkin Pilot-E PCI Express 3.0 boot SSD paired with a Samsung SSD 860 QVO SATA secondary drive. All this was packed in ADATA's XPG Invader chassis, fitted with a Deepcool GamerStorm Captain 240 EX 240mm liquid cooler, and an MSI 850-watt MPG A850GF power supply. For our gaming tests, we used an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, at Founders Edition clocks, as we have on all recent mainstream and high-end CPU reviews. We test CPUs using a variety of synthetic benchmarks that offer proprietary scores, as well as real-world tests using consumer apps such as 7-Zip, and AAA 3D games such as Far Cry 5. Out of the gate, we'll make it easy for you: Don't spend a load of time comparing the eight-core Core i9-11900K with the 12-core Ryzen 9 5900X, even though their suggested selling prices are very close to one another. Why? In nearly every benchmark, save for a win in our legacy-minded iTunes test (not optimized for multiple cores and threads) and our single-core POV-Ray test, the Ryzen 9 5900X is categorically a faster pick while also producing less heat with lower power requirements. If you're stuck between the two, simply stop reading here and grab yourself a Ryzen 9 5900X (if you can find one, of course).  That said, the Ryzen 9 5900X also had the privilege, when we tested it, of running on a mature motherboard platform that behaved exactly within expectations straight out of the box. Despite some driver stumbles with Ryzen launches in the past, the Ryzen 5000 Series was comparatively painless versus what we had to do to get the Core i9-11900K to work on our testbed within proper limits. The more interesting numbers are the ones we can't see. We didn't get an advance sample of the eight-core/16-thread Core i7-11700K ($399 suggested price) when it went on (premature!) sale earlier this month, nor were we sent one as a part of our press kit. We did, however, get some time with one in the MSI Aegis RS desktop that was sent to us for review (a prebuilt system), and it regularly beat out the Core i9-11900K in multicore tests, but trailed in single-core. (We haven't charted the Core i7-11700K in here because it was run on this different, retail system with slightly different settings.) Though there are differences in the builds (for one, the MSI desktop we tested worked out of the box with no tweaking), in our eyes this makes the case, however preliminary, for the Core i7-11700K as a likely better value-for-money eight-core option to consider at launch in Intel's high-end Rocket Lake lineup. Finally, if you don't mind going back one generation, the Comet Lake-based Core i9-10900K (with the help of our now-rock-steady Z490-based Asus ROG Maximus XII Hero Wi-Fi motherboard) posted substantially better results in multicore runs than what we saw during our runs of the 11900K. Of course, the 10900K is a 10-core/20-thread chip, so in highly threaded tasks, no amount of boost tweaking and thermal optimizing on Intel's part with the 11900K could pick up the slack in tasks when all the cores and threads are engaged. No matter which way you swing the Core i9-11900K bat, there's almost always another more cost-conscious processor to choose from, Intel or AMD. Here's what we saw in our bank of gaming tests with our GeForce RTX 2080 Ti card running the show. This top-end consumer graphics card is the primary arbiter of performance at 4K with all of the CPUs that we have laid out below. At 1080p, though, the card gets out of the way a bit more and lets the CPU differences shine. (We test with 3DMark Fire Strike Ultra and seven games.) Now, this is the first time in a long time that Intel has released a top-end processor that isn't the de facto gaming king straight out of the box. The Intel Core i9-9900K, the Core i9-9900KS, and the Core i9-10900K all set records across the board when they were released, especially in multi-threading-friendly games like Rainbow Six: Siege and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. But now that AMD has seriously upped its gaming chops with its Ryzen 5000 Series, Intel has some close company at the top of the charts. Though it makes a solid showing in most 1080p tests here, the 14nm Intel Core i9-11900K struggled in spots to keep pace with its 7nm competition from the likes of the Ryzen 7 5800X, the Ryzen 5 5600X, and even the Ryzen 3 3300X in limited 4K resolution runs where the GPU is doing all the heavy lifting. The Core i9-11900K takes an outright frame-rate victory in our 4K run of Rise of the Tomb Raider (84fps, moving the marker up by one), while also hitting new highs in both resolutions of our legacy run of Hitman: Absolution. Again, I should stress that this lack of total dominance may well be a byproduct of our power limitations put on the chip, which themselves were a necessity for basic operating system stability on the Core i9-11900K, let alone stability in a benchmark like Rise of the Tomb Raider. But even with what we saw, esports pros and users of high-refresh monitors won't find themselves disappointed much here, if at all. This rivalry in frame rates is a literal game of millimeters now, not even inches. In our attempts to push the Intel Core i9-11900K to its thermal limits in a 10-minute stress test in CoreTemp, we found no issues getting the CPU to post a maximum temperature of 96 degrees C in our testing, but beyond that the system crashed. On our next attempt, with stricter thermal limits in place, the temperatures were closer to reasonable, but still on the high end, peaking at 88 degrees C. In that profile, the Cinebench score was roughly 15% slower than the results we saw in the profile we used to benchmark. Again, we can't say for certain if this is because we're right on the limit of Intel's recommended cooling solution (a 240mm liquid cooler), or it's down to Asus' pre-tuning of the motherboard. Either way, once you look at the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X and its 12 cores that top out at just 83 degrees C in the same 10-minute run, it gets a little harder to give Intel the benefit of the doubt on this one. We know 14nm, pushed to the outer limits, is going to run hot. That's no surprise, but just how hot it runs this time around is a bit concerning. Don't skimp on the recommended cooler, is all we can say. Last, on the subject of overclocking, given that we couldn't get the Intel Core i9-11900K to post into Windows 10 using the stock motherboard profile, hitting a stable overclock profile was pretty quickly stricken off the list of options. Sure, I tried to overclock it, but I also sat there and watched the BIOS cycle itself through after I applied even a 50MHz boost to the CPU's clock speed using either the BIOS or Intel's own Extreme Tuning Utility. No dice in the early going. As we get more familiar with the issues of 11th Generation CPUs, and more BIOS updates are pushed post-launch, we'll circle back to overclocking to see if the chip can handle a more sizable boost later on. At the time of this review, we determined that the anomalous results we saw in our experience testing Intel's Core i9-11900K in PC Labs are down to a one-two punch. (Note the italic emphasis; your mileage may vary when you drive this chip, and on what motherboard.)  First is the BIOS stumble we had. While we were eventually able to wrangle it to a point where the chip wouldn't outright crash during testing, the only way to prevent the BIOS from pushing the Core i9-11900K over the edge was to enforce a few restrictions on the memory speed, the thermal limits, and the power budget. This prevents the numbers that we've gathered from serving as a perfect 1:1 comparison for other CPUs we've tested before it, seeing as how the current bank of Comet Lake numbers we have were all tested on a Z490 Asus ROG Maximus XII Hero motherboard, utilizing the onboard XMP II profile with all 16GB of our DDR4-3600MHz memory running at 3,000MHz.  Second are the limitations of our CPU cooler. When I asked Intel about recommended cooling during the initial press briefing for Rocket Lake during CES, the company said it recommended a 240mm liquid cooler as the minimum for what the Core i9-11900K would need to run comfortably. And while we have a 240mm AIO cooler installed, for the sake of this review we'll assume that either a 280mm or 360mm cooler might have, at least in some way, helped to close the gap in multicore performance between the Core i9-11900K in our testbed and the performance of the Core i7-11700K in our MSI Aegis RS desktop. Which brings us to the final issue: Who needs these chips? To be sure, there is a pool of Intel die-hards who have been waiting for PCI Express 4.0 to come to the platform and have potential peak I/O performance come up to parity with AMD. But for the rest, a Z490 board with a Core i9-10900K and a BIOS update will do the job just as well (on the same 240mm cooler, no less).  Now, we want to be fair to Rocket Lake and recognize that it is early days for the platform. We tested the Core i9-11900K sample we were shipped with an Intel-provided motherboard, first running on an early BIOS that was distributed to the press and then, when problems ensued, patched to the latest version from Asus. Does this mean your experience will be identical to ours? Hopefully not! This is the second straight Intel flagship CPU launch in which the motherboard drivers were volatile, and pre-launch problems aren't unusual for either brand. In 2020, we ran into issues with boost clocks when originally testing the 10th Generation Core i9-10900K on early BIOSes on the Z490 version of the Asus Hero. But since then it's become our bedrock testbed, used for testing dozens of graphics cards and Intel-based CPUs, and several hit record highs throughout the course of 2020. So it stands to reason, then, that the same kinks could soon get shaken out of 11th Generation Core. Right now, things are a bit wobbly, but not so much so that you can't see Intel's intention underneath it all. If the company can work with motherboard manufacturers to tune the out-of-the-box BIOS profiles to better suit the thermal and TDP limits of the Core i9-11900K, the CPU will likely become a solid-enough upgrade on an already solid-enough platform. ""Solid enough,"" though: That's the highest honor we can see it achieving, in a best-case scenario. The Core i9-11900K, as we've been able to test it, isn't a processor we'd recommend buying right out of the gate. You can get very close performance (and in some casesâahem, multi-threading!âbetter performance) from a Core i9-10900K, a chip that will slot just fine into select Z590 motherboards, if getting onto the latest platform is the deal-breaker in your upgrade-decision process. Even the Core i9-9900K remains a solid choice at this price point, if you can find one and happen to own a supporting LGA 1151 motherboard. But all of them, ultimately, are still overshadowed by AMD's Ryzens. If AMD's 3000 Series of desktop CPUs was a base hit, then the 5000 Series was a home run. The two remaining strongholds for Intelâsingle-threaded performance, and gaming performanceâwere, on a cost-to-performance ratio, breached in places by AMD in our benchmarks, though admittedly not by so much as to put Intel completely out of the race. In sum, the strength of AMD's latest Ryzen 7 and 9 5000 Series chips is impossible to ignore. In Intel's defense, the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X is a spectacular eight-core processor, one of the best we've ever seen, and to hit (or even come close to hitting) that bar on an aged-out lithography would be something special on Intel's part. That will have to wait, perhaps, for 12th Generation Core. Can't get mad at the magician for just performing tricks, instead of real magic, can we? Die-hard gamers and Intel loyalists can safely opt for the ""Rocket Lake"" Core i9-11900K, Intel's mainstream 11th Generation flagship desktop CPU. But a regression in core count and only modest performance upside add luster to AMD Ryzen 5000 and Intel 10th Gen alternatives.

intel-i9-11900K,tomshardware,"The lowered core count is an unavoidable side effect of Intel basing its new architecture on a design that originally debuted with its 10nm Ice Lake processors, but the decision to etch it onto the 14nm process left its chip designers with a leaner transistor density budget that ultimately resulted in fewer cores. Meanwhile, the six-core twelve thread Core i5-11600K lands with a much friendlier $262 price point that's much more competitive with AMD's comparable chips. In light of its price point, it has a very competitive price-to-performance ratio with the $300 Ryzen 5 5600X in a broad swath of games and applications. While the Core i5-11600K might not claim absolute supremacy, its mixture of price and performance makes it a solid buy. Provided, of course, that you can find any of these chips at close to sane pricing.  Intel's chip frequencies have become a confusing array of four different flavors of Turbo Boost, many with both single- and multi-core ratios, that differ based on each family of chips. We've narrowed these listings down to the peak boost frequencies in the table below, with each indicating the peak boosting tech used. We've also narrowed down the list of chips to the most important models. We'll circle back with a complete list of chips, specs, and boost definitions on the following page. As we've seen for several chip generations, Intel also offers graphics-less F-series models that have the same specs as their full-featured counterparts but come at a lower price point. Keep those in mind if you don't need integrated graphics.

The eight-core Core i9-11900K slots in as the flagship model for the Rocket Lake family. Fast clock speeds are a clear attraction, but they come at the expense of power â two of the chip's cores boost to a peak of 5.3 GHz, and all cores can operate at 4.8 GHz simultaneously. The 11900K has a 125W PL1 power rating (at the base frequency) and a 250W PL2 (boost) rating, both of which are identical to the previous-gen 10900K despite having two fewer cores.  The Core i9 K and KF models are Intel's first chips to come with Adaptive Boost Technology (ABT), which allows the processors to dynamically boost to higher all-core frequencies based upon available thermal headroom and electrical conditions (a bit more detail below). This new tech will feel decidedly familiar to AMD fans, as it operates in a very similar fashion to AMD's existing boost mechanism that's present in newer Ryzen processors.  The eight-core 16-thread flagship Core i9-11900K comes with a suggested $539 price tag, a $51 markup over the previous-gen ten-core 10900K. The 11900K slots in for $10 less than the Ryzen 9 5900X, which means we're looking at an eight-core chip taking on a 12-core 24-thread chip that will easily beat it in threaded workloads. Intel's obvious goal here is to beat the 5900X at gaming so it can justify the price tag. Notably, Intel's non-K Core i9 and i7 models carry the same pricing as their prior-gen counterparts. As per usual, K SKUs come without coolers, and you'll need a capable cooler to unlock the best of Rocket Lake. The Core i5-11600K contends directly with the $299 Ryzen 5 5600X in the heart of the mainstream gaming market, so this is an exceptionally important model. The $262 six-core Core i5-11600K matches the pricing of the previous-gen i5-10600K. The 11600K boosts to a peak of 4.9 GHz on two cores and can maintain a 4.6 GHz all-core frequency.  The 11600K comes with a 125W PL1 rating, the same as the previous-gen 10600K, but has a 251W PL2, a whopping 69W increase compared to the previous 182W limit. The Core i5-11400 also stands out as a potentially great deal, with $182 (or $157 for the F-series part) being a solid price for a six-core 12-thread processor. We have this processor inbound for review. Intel has stepped forward from DDR4-2933 to DDR4-3200, but the company also introduced a new paradigm with Rocket Lake: Only the Core i9 chips support DDR4-3200 in an optimal configuration at stock settings. This setting is called 'Gear 1,' and signifies that the memory controller and memory operate at the same frequency (1:1), thus providing the lowest latency and best performance in lightly-threaded work, like gaming.   All other Rocket Lake chips only officially support DDR4-3200 with the 'Gear 2' setting, which allows the memory to operate at twice the frequency of the memory controller (2:1) and results in higher data transfer rates, which can benefit some threaded workloads but also results in higher latency that can lead to reduced performance in some applications. Intel justifies the new segmentation approach because memory controllers fall into the binning equation, meaning chips with slower controllers are only rated for DDR4-3200 in Gear 2 mode. The official top speed for the Gear 1 setting is DDR4-2933 for all Core i7 and i5 chips, and running DDR4-3200 in lower-latency Gear 1 mode is considered overclocking. Intel isn't known for harsh memory overclocking restrictions when processing returns, but running memory beyond the spec does technically void your warranty. Intel has confirmed that all Rocket Lake-S chips come with the same eight-core die, with two cores disabled for the six-core models. Surprisingly, based on our rough projections, Rocket Lake's eight-core die is about 34% larger than the ten-core Comet Lake die.

In an odd twist, this could be a good development for enthusiasts because it should help make the chips easier to cool compared to the previous-gen models â the 11900K has the same peak power specifications and 34% more silicon area from which to dissipate the thermal load. That should bode well for the six core models, too, which have more inactive silicon to help absorb heat from neighboring cores. However, Intel has obviously decided to consume the extra thermal headroom by increasing the 11600K's power limit under heavy load by 69 watts.  Intel chalks much of the die size disparity up to GPU and CPU cores that are physically larger than those found on Comet Lake, a byproduct of backporting from 10nm to 14nm, along with the increased number of graphics EUs. Intel could have shrunk or removed the integrated graphics engine to cram in more CPU cores within its power, performance, area, and cost (PPAC) targets, but integrated graphics are a key requirement for the high-volume OEM systems market that tends to leverage on-chip graphics rather than discrete GPUs. As a result, Intel says it chose this balance of units to meet its design goals across the broader desktop PC market. Intel's 14nm process is ultra-mature, so we assume yields are superb, and also that the majority of its chipmaking equipment is depreciated, meaning it should be relatively cost-effective to punch out a flood of Rocket Lake chips while AMD remains supply constrained. However, fabbing a larger die exposes the chips to a greater chance of defects, thus complicating the binning process, potentially reducing yield, and resulting in fewer die per wafer. All of these factors conspire to increase manufacturing costs, which could help explain Intel's higher pricing for its highest-binned SKUs."
intel-i9-12900K,pcmag,"""Alder Lake,"" Intel's family of 12th Generation processors, has arrivedâand with it, a new CPU paradigm. Intel's Core i9-12900K desktop CPU ($589) leads the pack of the company's 12th Generation processors, and brings with it a whole host of upgrades and innovations to the desktops of now and tomorrow. These tick-ups include support for the new, high-speed DDR5 RAM standard, as well as an upgrade to PCI Express 5.0, on the first new motherboard platform to support the latest chips, the Intel Z690. Intel also worked closely with Microsoft to optimize the new CPUs for Windows 11, adding new scheduling features that intelligently load up the Core i9-12900K depending on which cores are being used where, and for what. Alder Lake and the Core i9-12900K indeed impress, but our relationship with the CPU...is complicated. For all the outright wins we saw in our benchmarks (and there were many), the added cost of upgrading to yet another new motherboard platform won't outweigh the win percentages for many shoppers. Intel's older-yet-still-reliable ""Comet Lake"" Core i9-10900K kept itself in the race during several benchmarks, while the eight-core, rather cheaper AMD Ryzen 7 5800X ($449 list price, but currently snipe-discounted to $386 on Amazon and Newegg) proves itself a worthy contender on performance-versus-price in PC gaming. The high cost of a new Z690 motherboard (the cheapest are just under $200, per our Z690 motherboard guide) and DDR5 adoption, along with Intel's insistence on upgrading your system to Windows 11, are all front-facing considerations for anyone who's considering 12th Generation Core as their next big desktop upgrade. Thatâand a not-insignificant problem in which our test platform, and several prebuilt Alder Lake PCs, could not launch certain popular games that use specific DRMâtemper Alder Lake with a bit of wait-and-see caution. Our initial Alder Lake takeaway is ""Intel's on the upswing, with some caveats."" But read more about our findings below. Leveraging Intel's so-called ""7 Process,"" the company's launch of its new 12th Generation desktop CPUs sees the new chips built on 10nm lithography, finally breaking the company out of its half-decade love/hate affair with the 14nm process and its subsequent ""14nm+""-based iterations that followed for years after. (Read more in-depth about how Intel defines its ""7 Process"" at ExtremeTech.) This is the first time Intel has moved one of its desktop consumer chip stacks completely beyond a form of the 14nm process in just over five years. AMD, via its manufacturing partnership with TSMC, has seen the Austin chip maker producing its wafers on 7nm lithography for nearly three years now, while Intel is just sidling up to 10nm. Is that a sign for what we should expect to see in benchmarks? Not if Intel's new bag of tricks has anything to say about it... Though this would normally be the part of the review where we dive straight into spec comparisons, let's take a quick sidebar first to learn a bit more about a ""big.LITTLE"" chip design: What is it, what does it mean for desktop processors, and do they really need it? In a big.LITTLE approach, a chip design stacks a set of cores focused on peak performance alongside cores focused more on efficiency and power management, both on the same die. That philosophy is nothing new; smartphone processors have been employing versions of a big.LITTLE architecture for years as an efficiency measure. It's also not technically new for Intel, eitherâthe company first launched an x86 processor based on a big.LITTLE design back in 2020, known as ""Lakefield."" The Lakefield silicon made it into only a few scattered laptops and mobile-device experiments, like the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Fold. But it set the pace for Intel's big announcement this year: Intel Performance Hybrid Architecture. Intel is touting Performance Hybrid Architecture as the company's ""biggest architectural shift in a decade."" In the technology's Alder Lake debut, the Core i9-12900K (along with the rest of the chips announced thus far in the 12th Generation desktop stack) will each come with two sets of heterogenous cores, instead of the monolithic core design we've seen in generations past. The core types are ""P-cores"" (""P"" being short for ""performance"") and ""E-cores"" (with the ""E"" for ""efficient""). The P-cores will be built on Intel's ""Golden Cove"" microarchitecture, while the E-cores are based on ""Gracemont."" This will help to explain the core/thread disparity that you'll see in the specs below, as only the P-cores will be Hyper-Threaded this time around (that is, supporting two processing threads per P-core), while E-cores will support just one thread per core. These P-cores and E-cores swap off various responsibilities under typical system usage, depending on the task at hand. P-cores, for example, are better for hitting peak performance during demanding tasks such as gaming, while the E-cores are better suited to picking up requests from background tasks that aren't as sensitive to lower latency speeds. Also, if there's a task that needs a lot of throughput at once (think multi-core rendering, and the like), the load can be balanced between both P-cores and E-cores, however the operating system's scheduler sees fit. That scheduler, then, is a key player, especially when the CPU's resources are much in demand. (And that demand is the point of buying any high-end CPU!) So, speaking of schedulers...meet Windows Thread Director, the ostensible Spielberg of the whole scheme. While Intel's approach to big.LITTLE may be old hat for smartphones and mobile devices, there's a lot of ""new"" on tap here for the laptop and desktop scene. To compensate for that newness, Intel has worked closely with Microsoft this time around, joint-developing a new scheduler for Windows 11, Intel Thread Director. Think of the scheduler as a traffic cop for Windows 11 (or any modern OS, for that matter): It tells bits of programs where they should each run on a processor, based on a variety of factors. That includes thermal/cooling capacity, available power draw, performance peaks, and task/thread priority. This process is relatively straightforward on traditional desktop-processor designs, and it works the same, in principle, on Windows 10 as it has in previous versions. With the introduction of hybrid architecture to the desktop market, however, Intel had to get creative. On a chip where the cores aren't homogenous, without a little extra help, Windows won't know which cores it can send programs to most optimally. Enter Thread Director. Thread Director is informed by a new microcontroller on the CPU itself, which will feed Windows 11 more detailed hardware telemetry about the current status of the chip and its cores, versus older releases in Intel's desktop line. Information that was previously left a mystery to Windowsâthink aspects like thermals, power settings, and which threads can take more instructionsâis now communicated to the scheduler in microseconds, leaving almost no impact and (in theory) adding considerable performance gains, depending on the workflow and the various kinds of overhead that can be leveraged. All of this is necessary, because as you'll see in our benchmarking results below, Windows 10 can be worse at scheduling a 12th Gen desktop CPU than Windows 11 is. This is mostly due to Windows 10 not knowing what it's looking at when it sees an E-core, thinking that it's just a low-performance core that doesn't have the same power spectrum on tap as the P-cores. As such, it can schedule the E-cores ""incorrectly,"" as it were (though that's an over-simplification), due to its limited information. Meanwhile, the added info being sent from Thread Director to the Windows 11 scheduler is all incorporated into the mix, which should, again in theory, add up to increased performance in that specific OS. Intel even provided several custom ""workflow"" benchmarks to its reviewer pool this time, designed to simulate those scenarios where the impact of its hybrid-architecture approach (and Thread Director's effect) would be most apparent. We ran the Photoshop and Premiere Pro versions of these benchmarks, which showed some impressive results that shouldn't be shoved aside as mere marketing hoopla. (More on that in a minute.) Last up, before we jump into the spec table, Intel has once again reclassified our known definitions of processor power draw. The company says it's now moving beyond the familiar Thermal Design Power rating (often expressed as ""TDP"" in watts), to its newest nomenclature, ""Base Power"" and ""Maximum Turbo Power."" In practice, things won't change all that much for consumers. Both 12th Gen and 11th Gen (""Rocket Lake"") chips at the Core i9 tier will retain their 125-watt Base Power rating on the back of the package. Rather, Base Power and Maximum Turbo Power are being used as a more accurate measurement of what kind of spectrum users can expect during both base and boost frequency peak usage, with the Core i9-12900K being rated at ""125-watt Base Power, 241-watt Turbo Power."" With that bomber-load of backgrounder out of the way, let's jump into a look at the full Alder Lake stack, with the Core i9-12900K at the top... First up, the obvious: Intel has chopped down the list of 12th Gen processors available at launch considerably from the 14 options rolled out for early 2021's 11th Gen/Rocket Lake debut, down to just six ""K"" and ""KF"" versions. (The KF chips lack integrated graphics.) These chips are all premium ones that are unlocked for overclocking, so it's tweakers and performance enthusiasts only for now, as far as Intel is concerned. (The premium Z690 motherboards going on sale for the initial Alder Lake launch reflect that focus.) That limited initial selection of chips is also priced much more aggressively (this time, against AMD's current stack of Ryzen 5000 processors) than we've seen in years past. While pecking away at AMD's MSRPs with recommended selling prices that are $10 lower is certainly nothing new (that's been a part of Intel's playbook for years), this is the first time in a while that the company's top-end offering, in this case the $589 Core i9-12900K, actually offers a better cost-per-core ratio than its aisle-adjacent competitor, the $749-MSRP Ryzen 9 5950X. Closer in price, though, is the Ryzen 9 5900X... The Core i9-12900K will feature eight P-cores and eight E-cores for a total core count of 16, and a maximum thread count of 24. Compare that to the Ryzen 9 5950X's 32 total threads, which could help to explain that $140 price disparity between the two in the eyes of Intel's marketing and pricing analysts. The Intel Core i9-12900K comes with the company's new Iris Xe UHD Graphics 770 silicon, though ""new"" is a bit generous, as the only changes from UHD Graphics 750 are a slightly reduced base clock speed (300MHz, from 350MHz), and an increased maximum dynamic frequency (up to 1.55GHz, from 1GHz). Though we didn't run any benchmarks on the integrated graphics processor (IGP) of the Core i9-11900K (partly because of time constraints, but mainly because few buyers will shop for this chip and not pair it with a graphics card), we recommend hopping over to our review of the Core i5-12600K to see just how much of an improvement gamers can expect. For those looking for an IGP that can just drive a display, though, the Iris Xe UHD Graphics 770 solution will support four 4K (up to 4,096-by-2,303-pixel) displays, at up to 60Hz. We'll discuss the implications of the Core i5-12600K and Core i7-12700K's individual price points in our reviews of those chips. However, overall, one can look at this latest stack of Intel processors and feel good that, for the first time in a long time, Intel is pricing its chips against the competition aggressively, in a way that doesn't skew the conversation in AMD's favor straightaway as a matter of basic math. Anyone prone to whiplash may want to skip this section, because yes, Intel has swapped sockets...again! The last hurrah for LGA 1200 was in March 2021 (just six months ago) with Rocket Lake's release (it came in with the previous 10th Generation Comet Lake chips), and now here we are with LGA 1700 today. However, unlike with LGA 1200 and its latter-day Z590 motherboards, which were widely (and accurately) regarded as a dead-end platform, Intel sounds more determined to keep LGA 1700 around for a bit this time. Launching on just one chipset platform this time aroundâZ690âwith rumors of more to come on cheaper chipsets next year, Intel is pinning its hopes on the idea that top-end overclocking-happy gamers who buy at this level of the stack (Core i5 and above) will be willing to spend at least $180 to get themselves onto 12th Gen. (At time of publication, this was the cheapest Z690 model we could find, an Asrock Phantom Gaming 4 model.) But what exactly do gamers get with all that new kit? Let's start with the selling points on the packaging: Support for PCIe 5.0, DDR5 memory up to 4,800MHz (5,200MHz with overclocking applied, and some boards going much higher), an upgrade to Intel's new XMP 3.0 memory overclocking profiles, WiFi 6E, and support for what Intel is calling its ""Dynamic Memory Boost Technology."" Also, an added DMI 4.0 x8 link will double Z690's effective PCI Express bandwidth, enabling two PCIe 4.0 drives to run at peak throughput without speed degradation. If you want to read a deeper dive on all the improvements that Z690 will have on offer for early adopters, check out our full article breaking down everything you need to know. So, here we are. After years of benchmarking and pricing defeats to upstart AMD Ryzen silicon in the desktop processor space, Intel is back with a whole new platform, a new lithography, new DDR5 memory, and Intel Thread Director at the ready. With all these tools on its belt, will the company finally be able to turn the tables on AMD? Let's dig into the results to find out... We tested the Core i9-12900K on an MSI MPG Z690 Carbon WiFi motherboard, with 32GB of Corsair Dominator memory clocked to 4,800MHz, and a 4TB Sabrent Rocket Q4 PCI Express 4.0 boot SSD that also functioned as our game drive. All this was packed in Corsair's iCue 7000D Airflow chassis, fitted with a Corsair iCue H150i Elite Capellix 360mm liquid cooler, and a Corsair 1,000-watt RM1000X power supply. For our gaming tests, we used an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti, at Founders Edition clocks, as we have on all recent mainstream and high-end CPU reviews. We test CPUs using a variety of synthetic benchmarks that offer proprietary scores, as well as real-world tests using consumer apps such as 7-Zip, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Premiere (the latter two using Puget Systems' PugetBench for Photoshop and Premiere extensions), multiplayer games like Rainbow Six: Siege, and AAA 3D games such as Assassin's Creed Valhalla. First up, CPU tests. We ran the various CPUs below (including the Alder Lake chips) under Windows 10, on appropriate testbeds built fresh for this generation of CPUs. (We also reran some of the tests on the Core i9-12900K under Windows 11 to get Thread Director into the mix.)  One note here: Since Intel has the platform handicap with the advent of Z690 and its included accoutrement of speedier features than AMD, we tested our AMD Ryzen 9 5950X on the most-tricked-out liquid-cooled system we had on hand, the Maingear Turbo (2021). While graphics tests won't be directly comparable (the RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3090 are a few percentage points apart in most games), the productivity tests of the Maingear, combined with its overkill liquid cooling, should bring a bit more parity between AMD's 16-core chip and Intel's new Core i9 16-core offering. Now, there's a sight for sore eyes! To repeat: Most of these results were collected on Windows 10 in order to keep things as even as possible to previous Intel CPU testing, as well as across the aisle to AMD. This is not, perhaps, an ideal matchup for Intel's Alder Lake, of course. Without Thread Director in play, in Windows 10, the 12th Generation Core i9-12900K can only post results that are either slightly ahead of AMD's 16-core 5950X in content creation, or ones that lose in some cases. Granted there's a $140 price disparity there, but there's also a RAM disparity, a platform disparity, a cooler disparity...you get the drift. A lot of loose factors are at play in this new world. In our more limited run of benchmarks on Windows 11 we did find that, in certain circumstances, Thread Director provided a sizable benefit. Sometimes the difference was negligible (for example, Cinebench R23, POV-Ray, and gaming tests all stayed roughly the same), while in others like the Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Premiere runs, we saw an improvement of nearly 30% in both benchmarks. Whether that means it's 30% faster in Windows 11 or 30% slower in Windows 10 is all a matter of your vantage point. But let's dig into that result for a moment. Intel was very specific in both its early marketing and reviewers' guidance about where the benefits of Thread Director would kick in, and as far as our benchmarking suite is concerned, Adobe Photoshop and Premiere Pro were the only applications that showed a visible benefit. That should perk up the ears of content creators, to be sure, but know that it's a situational benefit. However, that's just one pass of many to come. Thread Director, Windows 11, and Intel 12th Gen are all still in their infancy, and we expect the breadth of Thread Director's effects on your PC to increase in scope and power as all engineers involved refine things over time. That said, thus far as of launch, we only found those two cases where the effect was apparent, and you have to factor in the added cost of upgrading to Windows 11. Here's what we saw in our bank of gaming tests with our GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Founders Edition card running the show. This top-end consumer graphics card is the primary arbiter of performance at 4K with all of the CPUs that we have laid out below. At 1080p, though, the card gets out of the way a bit more and lets the CPU differences shine. (We test with 3DMark Time Spy and three AAA games.) These tests were run under Windows 10 except where noted. No, your eyes don't deceive you: Intel has carried its wins from content creation right on through to gaming, and for the first time in too long, has released a desktop gaming CPU that's competitive with AMD on both price and performance. Sure, games like F1 2021 are a ""gimme"" due to their RAM sensitivity, but both the 3DMark and Rainbow Six Siege results leave us optimistic that Intel can keep pace in the gaming race for at least the next several months (if rumors of Zen 4's launch date prove true). And while normally we'd take the rest of this section to talk about all the nuances of the results and what they could mean for Intel's new position in PC gamer's minds, there's just one problem we noted: The Core i9-12900K can't play every game. Italics intentional. The sheer boldness of that statement may not have caught everyone on the first pass, so let's reiterate: Intel's latest gaming processor, marketed by the company as the ""World's Best Gaming Processor,"" may not play certain games. It's dependent on the digital rights management (DRM) system used by the game to protect its licenses. The culprit? All that P-core/E-core stuff we mentioned up above. During the course of our testingâwhich includes two runs of the popular title Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, one in 1080p and the other in 4Kâwe found the game would either crash halfway through the test run, or simply not boot in at all. We tried to test as many titles as we could ahead of this review, but time was already a factor with the benchmarking suite we had, let alone following behind Intel's late-stage answer about DRM compatibility with a trail of games that may or may not launch on the first go. Upon speaking to Intel about the issue, we were told this was down to Denuvo DRM, a protection method that many single-player and multiplayer games use to validate the license of a game online. This DRM system keeps games protected from piracy, and over the years Denuvo has proven itself to be one of the most difficult DRMs out there to crack. This makes it especially popular with developers of AAA single-player games, those who are often hardest hit when a game that costs millions to develop gets cracked for free within a few days of release (sometimes even sooner). The issue with games like Assassin's Creed: Valhalla arises either on launch or on load, because Denuvo thinks that the P-cores and E-cores belong to two separate systems, rather than two different core types on the same chip. Once it detects that some portion of the load has been split between the P and E cores, it sees the new cores as a new license holder (a separate system), and force-quits the game to prevent what it believes is two PCs trying to play one game on the same key. When quizzed on how widespread this issue is, Intel had this to say: ""We are aware of a DRM issue with Assassinâs Creed: Valhalla, and we are working with the game publisher on a fix. There are select game titles that have had issues running on 12th Gen Core platforms due to a DRM issue. These issues have been addressed via game patches and OS updates for most games in Windows 11. Windows 10 updates will begin next year."" [Editor's Note: Intel has released a statement regarding Denuvo functionality on Intel 12th Gen processors. Workarounds are coming, but no determinate figure on when just yet.) What does ""select game titles,"" and ""most games in Windows 11,"" mean? Will Windows 10 get its necessary updates before December of 2022? No specificity to be found. We couldn't even get a number on how many games are affected, either because Intel wasn't willing to share or because it doesn't know. At the time of publication of this review, we have only the Assassin's Creed: Valhalla data to fall back on, but the problem was consistent across three separate Windows 10 and 11 machines equipped with an Alder Lake Core i9: our main testbed, and two prebuilt systems sent to us by OEMs for review. This is the reason you won't see any AC: Valhalla results in this review, nor our reviews of two new 12th Gen systems from Alienware (the new Alder Lake-based Aurora R13) and Velocity Micro (its latest Raptor Z55, also based on the Core i9). Assassin's Creed: Valhalla has been a part of our system testing regimen for months (without issue), and this is a new phenomenon. Finally, to be clear, this isn't some old Podunk game we dug out of the bargain bin to see what would break 12th Generation Core just for fun... Anyone who knows how much money Ubisoft generates per year should be wholly impressed with that figure, as it suggests that AC: Valhalla (and its many released/scheduled DLCs) will be a staple in the publisher's content strategy for the next year, at least. And Intel 12th Gen processors, until there's a fix, will flat-out not play it. If you enjoy Assassin's Creed: Valhalla (or any Denuvo game, for that matter), this issue should be at the forefront of your mind before you make your 12th Gen purchase. This is the first time we've had to exclude a benchmark from our testing because the gaming processor we're benching explicitly won't play the game. That's a lot of italics to emphasize the impact of this big hiccup in Intel's otherwise impressive run of results here. We'll be testing more Denuvo-protected titles in the coming weeks to get a more complete picture of how widespread the issue may be on both Windows 10 and Windows 11, but until then we would advise gamers to use this list to look for (possibly) unlaunchable titles. Last up on our list of test runs was an area to which Intel was keen to dedicate a significant portion of its briefings to the press: overclocking. Due to the increased complexity and depth that's been added to the Z690 platform for overclockers, we'll be publishing a separate article that takes a much deeper look at everything that's on offer here. In the meantime, we chose to run with Intel's latest version of its Extreme Tuning Utility (XTU) and its simple sliders to see what we could get done on a time budget. In those runs on the Core i9-12900K, I was able to achieve a surprisingly comfortable peak overclock of around 8% across all cores, a figure that will almost assuredly climb higher once I start overclocking E-cores and P-cores independently of one another. This resulted in a near-parity gain in our F1 2021 run, as well as around a 5% bump to Cinebench R23 and the Puget Systems/Adobe Photoshop test. Not a huge bump, but also one that was the easiest to achieve given the one-slider tools provided to us by Intel. Finally, to close out our testing (we always leave the stress runs for last in case of disaster), our attempts to push the Intel Core i9-12900K to its thermal limits in a 10-minute run through Cinebench 23 in CoreTemp, we found the CPU posted a maximum temperature of 73 degrees C in our testing on a new Corsair iCue 360mm closed-loop liquid cooler. This is a fine result, but one that's tempered slightly (no pun intended) by the oversized cooler we were sent to test with. A 360mm liquid cooler of any flavor or brand is big. If you run on air or any liquid cooling radiator smaller than 360mm, your results may vary. You'll need something; the Core i9-12900K doesn't come with a cooler in the box, and your cooler must support the new LGA 1700 socket. Intel has taken its lumps from critics and tech reviewers over the past several years (this reviewer included), and for the first time in a while the company has a stack of consumer processors that, under specific circumstances and use cases, aren't out of the race before they even get off the line. Even if it's not leading in advanced process technology, Alder Lake is a definite turning point. This time around, Intel has launched a Core i9 chip that, at least from our limited run of predetermined benchmarks, looks like the next big-ticket item for content creators who take their time management seriously. For years, AMD has enjoyed a comfortable lead in content creation with its lead in process technology and sheer core/thread count for the money. As Intel finally gets its cost-per-core up to parity, it finds itself able to compete in ways that 14nm rarely allowed for. However, this launch is also a bit of an odd duck, in that our AMD Ryzen comparison numbers (by the nature of the Ryzen platform) are all on an AMD X570-based motherboard that only supports DDR4 RAM up to 3,600MHz, versus spanking-new, fast DDR5 on the Alder Lake platform. This means both some games (think F1 2021) and applications (Photoshop) that are sensitive to RAM timings and speeds will inevitably skew in Intel's favor for this round of testing. We look forward to benching on more motherboards in the future that will give us an opportunity to see how a Z690 DDR4 board holds up in results. But before we wrap up our review, we thought we'd build out a quick table that outlines the estimates (via data pulled from Newegg and Amazon on the date of publish, as well as pricing information we've been given by OEMs directly), on approximately what it would cost you to upgrade to Intel 12th Gen versus competing options. Below we've cobbled together a few systems on the AMD side that, including both a B550 motherboard and some (budget) DDR4 RAM, came out to about $100 as a combo deal. Meanwhile, we've factored in the cost of both a Windows 11 license and the cost of DDR5 on the side of Intel. However, you can also buy Z690 boards that support DDR4, which cuts a percentage off the final tab. Cooling is also a factor, not mapped here; LGA 1700 will require a new cooler (nothing comes in the box), but so will the 5900X. This math is especially important for gamers during GPU-starved times like these, when finding a new graphics card at MSRP is often down to the luck of the draw in a lottery. Every dollar toward your build counts double nowadays, and if you're going to be paying out the nose for your GPU already, the last thing you should overspend on is the rest of your hardware around it. For content creators, the cost proposition of 12th Gen perks up, thanks to several outright wins that prove Intel's 16 cores are, in select cases, just as capable in performance as AMD's Ryzen 9 5950X and Ryzen 9 5900X. But on cost of adoption, the percentages are still skewed in AMD's favor for many PC builders and upgraders. That aspect, and that AMD chips will play just about any game that works on your chosen version of Windows...not whatever gets patched on Windows 11 on a game-by-game basis. Any game, almost any OS. We didn't think that would be a point in the ""Pros"" column for any processor launched in 2021, but Intel's first major foray into desktop big.LITTLE seems not without its own initial complications. We've benched a whole lot of AMD and Intel processors here over the past few years, and Alder Lake does come to the CPU circus with a basket of hoops to jump through: new power limits, possibly the need for new RAM, new cooler sizes on a new socket, new caveats around game compatibility, the need for Windows 11 to get the most out of the chip. Meanwhile, AMD has been a model of stable on AM4: Build the PC, hit play, and enjoy the show. If you want the ""world's best gaming processor"" todayâas in a desktop processor that just plays any PC game you wantâyou might want to wait and see how the DRM situation shakes out on Alder Lake. But the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X remains a cost-conscious, fuss-free option that kept its station in gaming in Windows 10. Ultimately, Intel can own these wins on the Core i9-12900K for what they are: an impressive first showing for its desktop processors built off the new 7 Process, albeit one with some caveats included. The Ryzen 9 5900X and 5950X, meanwhile, remain slightly slower, but reliably more cost-competitive, alternatives for content creators: no hoop-jumping required. But it looks like desktop CPUs are poised to be a race again in 2022 and beyond. The Core i9-12900K is Intel's first truly innovative high-end desktop CPU in years, showing great potential in its performance/efficiency mixed-core design and support for DDR5 memory. Just expect a high initial cost of adoptionâand, perhaps, some PC-gaming growing pains. Sign up for Lab Report to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.

intel-i9-12900K,tomshardware,"Alder Lake chips support both DDR4 and DDR5 memory, but there are several caveats tied to DDR5. As a default, DDR5 runs in Gear 2 mode, resulting in higher latency. Additionally, standard motherboards only support DDR5-4800 if the motherboard has only two physical slots. Therefore, at stock settings, Alder Lake only supports DDR5-4400 on any motherboard with four slots â even if only two slots are populated. Support drops as low as DDR5-3600 if four slots are filled with dual-rank memory DIMMs. Here are the population rules for DDR5: And with that, let's take a look at performance in both Windows 10 and 11 on the following pages. "
intel-i9-13900K,pcmag,"Just weeks prior to this review, AMD managed to claim the processor performance crown from Intel with its Ryzen 9 7950X, which has been the worldâs fastest consumer-oriented processor for that short period of time. Unfortunately for AMD, Intel never sits still. Now, with the launch of the 13th Generation ""Raptor Lake"" Core i9-13900K, Intel is taking back the crown. Intelâs approach with the Core i9-13900K differs significantly from the path AMD takes with its new Zen 4 processors. Whereas AMD's Zen 4 design is a drastic departure from its Zen 3 architecture, Intel's Raptor Lake design is an iteration on the Alder Lake that preceded itâAMD is pushing performance and efficiency with fewer cores, while Intel is piling them on, and to great effect. Still, the new Core i9 doesnât manage to be quite better in all areas, particularly in heat and power consumption. But if getting the fastest performance possible is your top priority, then the $589 Core i9-13900K is unquestionably the best processor you can buy, earning it our Editors' Choice award. Intelâs 12th Gen processor line, better known as âAlder Lake,â marked a significant change in the way the company builds its processors. Traditionally, Intel has only utilized a single CPU architecture, but with Alder Lake, it essentially adopted Armâs big.LITTLE design philosophy. Inside of high-end Alder Lake processors are high-performance CPU cores named P-Cores, and smaller, more energy-efficient cores known as E-Cores. The core concept of this design is to improve energy efficiency by running low-priority, low-performance tasks on the E-Cores and running performance-hungry workloads on the P-Cores. Thatâs far from the only benefit of this design, however, as all of the cores can be used at the same time. The extra E-Cores, which simply werenât present on 11th Gen processors, give a significant performance boost to all of the processors that contain them. While not all Alder Lake processors contain E-Coresâand the E-Cores aren't as powerful as their P-Core counterpartsâthe ones that do contain E-Cores are notably faster, thanks to their higher overall core count. When it comes down to it, Alder Lake of 2021 and Raptor Lake of 2022 arenât all that different, which is why it was important to go over Alder Lake first. Intel made a few subtle changes under the hood, but by far the most notable change is a significant increase in core count. Whereas the Alder Lake Core i9-12900K has eight P-Cores and eight E-Cores, the new Core i9-13900K contains eight P-Cores and 16 E-Cores. Intel increased the size of the L3 and L2 caches on the Core i9-13900K as well, giving it 36MB of L3 cache and 32MB of L2 cache. The Core i9-12900Kâs L3 cache pool isnât much smaller at 30MB, but its L2 cache is significantly smaller at just 14MB. Clock speeds have also increased on both types of processor cores, with Core i9-13900Kâs P-Cores operating 600MHz faster than the P-Cores in the Core i9-12900K, and the E-Cores on the Core i9-13900K operating 400MHz higher. Last but not least, the maximum supported memory speed has also increased from 4,800MHz on Alder Lake to 5,600MHz on Raptor Lake. Altogether, Raptor Lake is clearly not a significant departure from Alder Lake in terms of overall design. Instead, Raptor Lake derives most of its performance gains from simply running faster and having more cache and cores to do the work. As you likely expect and will soon see, this is a very effective way to boost performance if done correctly, and Intel has certainly managed to do it the right way. One last key detail that determines this, which we havenât brought up until now, is power. The more power a processor requires, the hotter itâs going to run, and that can cause all sorts of performance problems. Adding more cores simply wouldnât help much if the chip consumes a great deal more power and is constantly overheating. Somewhat surprisingly given the increase in resources, the Core i9-13900K is not radically more power-hungry than its predecessor. It consumes more power and it certainly runs hotter than weâd like, but neither of these points are problematic enough to keep the processor from outperforming everything else in our charts. The Core i9-13900K contains an integrated graphics processor (IGP) that is identical to the one found inside many Alder Lake processors, including the Core i9-12900K. The Intel UHD Graphics 770 contains 32 execution units, or EUs, and it operates at 1.65GHz inside of the Core i9-13900K, an increase of 100MHz over the Core i9-12900K. Raptor Lake processors will run just fine inside of existing Alder Lake motherboards, but Intel also launched a new Z790 chipset for Raptor Lake, too. The Z790 chipset is able to support an additional eight PCI-E 4.0 lanes than Z690, and it also can support an extra USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 port. The chipsetâs integrated Wi-Fi controller is now based on an Intel Killer Wi-Fi 6E design as well. We tested the Core i9-13900K on a Gigabyte Z790 Aorus Master motherboard with two 16GB sticks of DDR5 memory in a dual-channel configuration. This RAM was operated at the Core i9-13900Kâs maximum officially supported memory speed of 5,600MHz. Other tested CPUs were operated at lower RAM speeds according to their respective supported maximums. A Cooler Master MasterLiquid PL240 Flux 240mm water cooler was utilized to keep the chip from overheating. Power came from a SilverStone DA850 PSU and all tests were performed inside Windows 11. An open-air Praxis Wetbench was used to hold all of the parts during testing. For the game tests with a graphics card, we used an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition. This was also used in the system during all CPU and power tests as a display adapter. The card was only removed while testing the CPUâs integrated graphics. AIDA64âs memory and cache bandwidth test is a useful tool for gauging the capabilities of processors. Keeping a processor fed with data is essential to maximizing its performance and preventing stalls, but these numbers need to be considered carefully. Different processor designs respond differently to changes in cache size and memory bandwidth. Due to its higher supported memory speeds, the Core i9-13900Kâs memory bandwidth was the highest out of all chips that we tested. The processor also showed excellent L1 cache bandwidth that was drastically better than Core i9-12900K. The Core i9-13900Kâs L2 cache performance wasnât great though, and lagged behind AMDâs Ryzen 9 7950X. When it comes to raw CPU performance, the Core i9-13900K was able to outperform all of the competing CPUs in our charts in nearly all tests. AMDâs Ryzen 9 7950X gave the Core i9-13900K a run for its money and came close to matching it in some tests, and it pulled ahead to secure a slim win on our Adobe Premiere Pro test. Nonetheless, in terms of pure CPU performance, the Core i9-13900K is unquestionably the better of the two chips. In game tests, there are a lot more variables that come into play, and the Core i9-13900K doesn't really stand out from the pack. We should mention that there is likely a glitch behind our 3DMark test results, as there isnât any reason the Core i9-12900K should be faster in that test. The rest of the test scores are more sensible though. In F1 22, the Core i9-13900K achieved arguably its best win as far as games go, with sizable performance leads at all tested resolutions. In Marvelâs Guardians of the Galaxy, it more or less tied for first with several other chips. Total War: Three Kingdoms was another close one, with a few chips including the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X and the three tested Alder Lake chips performing slightly better at 1080p. In our two legacy game tests, the Core i9-13900K did surprisingly well with a small win in Tomb Raider at 1080p and more pronounced wins at all resolutions in Bioshock: Infinite. As mentioned earlier, the IGP in the Core i9-13900K is the same as that in many Alder Lake chips except it is clocked slightly higher. It likely gains some benefit from the faster RAM, as GPUs are typically much more sensitive to changes in memory and bandwidth than processors. In general when testing the IGP, we saw exactly what youâd expect with the above information in mind. The Core i9-13900K with its Intel UHD 770 Graphics IGP performed the best, and slightly better than the older Alder Lake chips in three out of our four tests. The only exception was in Tomb Raider, which showed the Core i9-13900K running significantly slower, likely due to an increased load on the processor causing the IGP to throttle. We measure the total power consumption of the system using a Kill-A-Watt power meter. As a result, our numbers show power consumption from all components and not just the CPU, but as the CPU is the main component being changed, the bulk of any difference shown in the charts here can be ascribed to the processor. The system with the Core i9-13900K pulled more power during this test than any of the other processors we have tested to date. The chip also ran hot during the tests and frequently hit 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit), which is the hottest among these CPUs, but is also its officially listed safe maximum operating temperature. Though energy efficiency certainly appears to be worse than the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X, we canât really knock the Core i9-13900K for its high operating temperature. AMD set its Ryzen 9 7950X and its Ryzen 7 7700X with safe maximum operating temperatures of 95 degrees Celsius (203 degrees Fahrenheit), and both of those chips will throttle to prevent exceeding these temperatures. Intelâs Core i9-12900K and Core i9-13900K are both doing this as well, except at a higher temperature. Effectively, this means that all of these chips would actually run even hotter if their built-in safeties werenât keeping them from melting down. As such, we canât really tell which of these chips would run the hottest if they were unrestrained. What we can say for sure is that you really need to have at least a 240mm water cooler for any of these chips, as thatâs what we used and we still managed to max things out. We opted not to experiment with overclocking, knowing we already reached our cooling limit. With the highest CPU test scores we've seen, thereâs no question that Intelâs Core i9-13900K is the fastest consumer-oriented CPU you can buy, earning it our Editors' Choice award. Does that mean it's right for you? It depends on what else you're considering. Compared with the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X, the chips performed similarly in many tests, but the Core i9-13900K is clearly the better option. Why? Because it costs less, at $589 to the Ryzen 9 7950Xâs $699. If youâre looking for something primarily for gaming, there are a lot of other options that you can consider, as the Core i9-13900K doesnât really offer a lot of extra performance over, say, the Core i5-12600K, the Ryzen 7 7700X, or even the Ryzen 7 5700X. If youâre on a budget, itâs likely better to opt for one of these more affordable CPUs and put what you save toward a better graphics card. This is also our advice if you own a small form factor, mini-ITX PC. Lastly, if youâre looking at the Core i9-13900K as an upgrade option, that all depends on what you're currently running. Realistically, thereâs a lot of extra performance in the Core i9-13900K over even the likes of the Core i5-12600K or the Core i9-11900K. If you have a PC thatâs running an 11th Gen or older processor, or you have a lower-end Alder Lake CPU, the Core i9-13900K could make for an excellent upgrade. Intel's ""Raptor Lake"" Core i9-13900K is the fastest CPU on the market, with leading performance and a higher core count than the competition.

intel-i9-13900K,tomshardware,"The 13th-Gen Intel 'Raptor Lake' $589 Core i9-13900K and the $319 Core i5-13600K bring groundbreaking levels of performance to their respective price points, with a ~20% generational jump in gaming performance taking the lead over competing chips from AMDs Ryzen 7000 series. We tested all three of the new Raptor Lake chips with the new Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 to find the best CPU for gaming and the new leader of our CPU benchmark hierarchy. Raptor Lakes performance gains come from record-high clock speeds that stretch up to 5.8 GHz, with a 6 GHz model coming, while Intels generous sprinkling of more cores throughout its product stack gives it the lead in core counts for the first time since AMDs Ryzen debuted back in 2017.In many respects, Raptor Lake is an iteration of the microarchitectures found in the previous-gen Alder Lake chips, but with expansive improvements that yield explosive performance gains. Even though Intel still uses the Intel 7 process node, it leveraged impressive advances in a newer revision of the silicon to push clock speeds higher while improving power efficiency. Intel also etched the cores on a new, larger die with more cores and L3 cache and exposed previously unused L2 cache.Paired with fine-grained tuning and expanded use of features in the core, Raptor Lake yields the types of performance gains we would normally only expect from the transition to a new process node. Those types of advances are needed as Intel attempts to fend off the 5nm Ryzen 7000 processors, like the Ryzen 9 7950X and Ryzen 5 7600X, that recently took the lead over Alder Lake.Like its predecessor, Raptor Lake supports the latest connectivity standards, including PCIe 5.0 and DDR5, with the latter now supporting faster official speeds of DDR5-5600. Intel also preserves DDR4 support for less-expensive build options - a pronounced advantage over AMDs Ryzen 7000, especially on midrange options. Raptor Lake will also drop into existing motherboards to offer an upgrade path for Alder Lake users, but new 700-series motherboards offer slightly expanded connectivity options. Intel also introduced more CPU overclocking features.Of course, there are caveats. Intels new chips are its most power-efficient yet, but like AMD, Intel has taken a power-be-damned approach to regain leadership, dialing up its power limits for all the desktop PC chips. That means the heat can be hard to control, so youll need to plan for a beefy cooling solution. On the flip side, you can now easily overclock to the highest clock rates weve ever seen, and that's even without using exotic cooling. For instance, we dialed in 5.6 GHz all-core overclocks with relative ease with an AIO watercooler.Intel did raise the price of the Core i5-13600K model, but it kept the same pricing for the Core i7 and i9. With the companys continued aggressive chip pricing and options for lower-priced platforms and memory, the 13th-Gen Raptor Lake processors are now the best CPUs for gaming and most other work, even if they dont take the outright performance lead in all threaded workloads.Intel's initial Raptor Lake launch includes three overclockable chips, and each has two variants, giving you the option for cheaper graphics-less KF-series models. Intel is expected to release the remaining 16 processors in the lineup early next year. Just like the previous-gen chips, the 13th-Gen Raptor Lake processors come with a mix of both big performance cores (p-cores) for latency-sensitive work and small efficiency cores (e-cores) for threaded and background applications. The e-cores stick with the same Gracemont architecture as before, but the p-cores move from the Golden Cove design to Raptor Cove. We'll cover the architecture more in-depth after the benchmarks.The 24-core 32-thread $589 Core i9-13900K will square off with AMD's 16-core $699 Ryzen 9 7950X, so Intel has a pricing advantage. The Core i9-13900K has the highest clock rates of the new chips, with a 600 MHz generational improvement bringing it to a 5.8 GHz peak that sets a record for mainstream desktop PCs. Intel employs Thermal Velocity Boost and Turbo Boost 3.0 tech for the Raptor Lake Core i9 models, so the 13900K will have to meet certain temperature (under 70C) and power conditions to boost to 5.8 GHz on two cores. Intel has also raised the boost frequencies for both p-cores and e-cores on all Raptor Lake chips, but reduced the base clocks by 200 MHz. The latter shouldn't mean much in practical application - this is done to manage the Base Turbo Power (BTP) rating.The 13900K has the same 125W BTP as before, but Intel increased the Maximum Turbo Power (MTP) by 12W, bringing it to 253W. Thats a new height for desktop processors, outstripping Ryzen 7000s peak 230W rating.The Core i9-13900K has eight more e-cores than its predecessor, delivering much more threaded horsepower and technically taking the core count lead on the mainstream desktop PC over the 16-core Ryzen 9 7950X. In contrast, AMDs design employs only cores that are analogous to performance cores, so well have to look to the benchmarks to suss out the winners instead of relying upon core counts alone. The e-cores come with a 400 MHz increase to the boost clock, bringing them to 4.3 GHz. Even though the e-cores use the same Gracemont architecture, Intel claims that changes to the caching policy and other fine-grained optimizations (more below) now yield the same IPC and frequency as the original 14nm Skylake cores, but at lower power.The Core i9-13900K is the only Raptor Lake chip to come with Intel's Adaptive Boost Technology (ABT). In a nutshell, ABT allows Core i9 processors to dynamically boost to higher all-core frequencies based upon available thermal headroom and electrical conditions, so the peak frequencies can vary. It also allows the chip to operate at 100C during normal operation to extract the utmost performance from your setup. We cover this more on the third page.The $409 Core i7-13700K received a 400 MHz p-core frequency bump to 5.4 GHz, an additional four e-cores for a total of eight, and a 400 MHz e-core boost to 4.2 GHz. Intel also increased the MTP for this chip to 253W, a 63W increase over the prior-gen Core i7-12700K (+33%).The $319 Core i5-13600K has four more e-cores than the prior gen, and Intel increased the p-core clocks by 200 MHz to reach 5.1 GHz. Intel also bumped the e-cores up by 300 MHz to achieve a 3.9 GHz boost. Naturally, this means the chip will consume more power - the 13600K also has a 31W higher MTP than the prior gen, weighing in at 181W (+20%).The Core i5-13600K looks to be the most impressive Raptor Lake chip if youre willing to overclock, as we easily attained a 5.6 GHz overclock that nearly matches the stock Core i9-13900Ks gaming performance. Youll have to pay for the privilege, though. The $319 Core i3-13600K is the lone chip to receive a price increase; both the full-fledged model and the graphics-less 13600KF are $30 more expensive than the prior gen. Intel has confirmed that e-cores are also coming to more of the Raptor Lake Core i5 lineup. Currently, only the Core i5 'K' Alder Lake model has four e-cores, while the others do not.Some of the improvements apply to all three chips. For example, Intel increased the L2 cache from 1.25MB to 2MB for each p-core and doubled the amount of L2 cache for each cluster of e-cores to 4MB. The amount of L3 cache has also increased due to adding more e-core clusters, each of which has an adjacent L3 cache slice as part of the design. That leads to cache capacity increases for all K-series Raptor Lake chips.Intel has increased its DDR5 memory support up to 5600 MT/s if you use one DIMM per channel (1DPC), a big increase over the prior 4800 MT/s speed with Alder Lake. Just as importantly, Intel increased 2DPC speeds up to 4400 MT/s, an improvement over the previous-gen 3600 MT/s. Raptor Lake also continues to support DDR4 memory, which Intel predicts will coexist in the market with DDR5 until the end of 2024. This approach ensures a value option for Intel platforms, unlike AMD's all-in approach with DDR5.Both Raptor Lake and Alder Lake drop into motherboards with the LGA 1700 socket, so theyll both work with existing 600-series or new 700-series chipsets. Intel says that, on a like-for-like basis, you shouldnt see any performance differences if you use a previous-gen 600-series motherboard for Raptor Lake. As usual, Intel will bring its Z-series (Z790, in this case) motherboards to market first, with the value-centric B- and H-series coming when it launches the rest of the Raptor Lake lineup.The 700-series motherboards bring minor improvements over the 600-series, but Intel has increased the number of PCIe 4.0 lanes hanging off the chipset to 20, an increase of eight additional lanes. Intel also added support for one more USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 200Gps port, bringing the total to five. As before, the Raptor Lake chip itself supports 16 lanes of PCIe 5.0 and four lanes of PCIe 4.0 for a storage device.Intel doesnt include a cooler with the Raptor Lake processors but recommends a 280mm AIO watercooler or air equivalent (or greater). Existing LGA 1700 coolers are compatible with the new Raptor Lake motherboards but bear in mind that the performance of your cooler can significantly limit performance, so it's best to overprovision. Youll need to ensure you have a beefy cooler for stock operation with the Core i9 and i7 models, and even an overclocked Core i5-13600K can challenge lower-end 240mm AIOs.The Raptor Lake iGPU is based on the same Xe-LP Gen 12.2 architecture found with Alder Lake. Aside from minor clock speed improvements, there arent any changes to the iGPU, so you shouldnt expect any meaningful gaming performance."
intel-i9-14900K,pcmag,"When crunch time for holiday sales comes around, not every tech company has something truly new to push out every year. Thatâs where Intel finds itself this year, as its upcoming ""Meteor Lake"" processors are all about laptops and arenât slated for a desktop release. Instead, Intel has employed the tried-and-tested method of a product-line refresh to keep its chips moving. Brand-new, or at least newly named, chips based on the companyâs existing high-performance ""Raptor Lake"" microarchitecture have potential as something exciting to game with while we wait for a new-architecture successor (likely ""Arrow Lake"") to land. Intel has done generational refreshes like this one before, and it has worked well in the past. Not so much in 2023, though: While the potential is here, the $589 Intel Core i9-14900K generates a lot of heat and excess power draw. This isn't a bad chip, with the right extra-robust cooler on top of it. but Intel's logic behind this refresh is difficult to see beyond issuing a space-filler until next-gen architecture firms up. Although the new Core i9-14900K processor begins with â14â instead of â13,â it is still a member of the 13th Gen Raptor Lake family and relies on the Raptor Lake architecture. More than architecturally similar to the preceding Intel Core i9-13900K and Intel Core i9-13900KS, the Core i9-14900K is in fact entirely identical to these other chips on a macro level. All three of these CPUs have the same number of cores, the same amount of cache, and even close to the same clock speeds. (The core count, as a reminder, is 24 cores, comprising eight Performance cores and 16 Efficient cores, allowing for a total of 32 addressable threads via Hyper-Threading.) This begs the question (or two): Why create the Core i9-14900K in the first place, and why bother with this whole refresh thing? Historically, refreshing a processor line is a practical move, with notable gains in performance for customers and at times reduced pricing. Either way, this move has often proved financially beneficial to AMD and Intel in the past. The reason a refreshed processor line tends to work well is due to improvements in manufacturing technology. Essentially what happens is that as the company produces more of the same chips, its current manufacturing technology matures, leading to a gradual increase in overall yields and the quality of individual processors. These improvements sometimes reduce costs, but more important they can make it possible to lower power consumption, add additional resources, or increase clock speed. At times, this has led to some highly successful lines of rehashed products. Over the last decade, Intel has produced several refresh lines, including the Haswell Refresh, the Kaby Lake Refresh, and the Coffee Lake Refresh. However, just because it has worked before doesnât mean it will work every time. Thermal limits arenât so easy to overcome and, while clock speed continues to increase each generation, it does so slowlyâand only when power, thermals, and design permits. Intel already pushed its Raptor Lake processors to operate at relatively high clock speeds, which is all well and good, but it left little room for overclocking, and it leaves even less room now for the Raptor Lake Refresh chips to be clocked higher. The result of this is that we are left with refreshed chips that are clocked only slightly higher than their predecessors. The Intel Core i9-13900K shipped with a max boost clock speed of 5.8GHz, which is pushed up to only 6GHz on the Core i9-14900K. This slight increase represents a mere 3% increase in performance, which is a boost so small that we tend to glaze over results of 3% or less as inside of the margin of error. This marginal performance gain is further undercut by the existence of Intelâs Core i9-13900KS, which is effectively a Core i9-13900K that operates with a max turbo clock of 6GHz right out of the box. This makes it identical even in terms of clock speed to the Core i9-14900K, but it also makes it clear that Intel didnât raise the absolute clock ceiling for its Raptor Lake processors with the new refresh line. Also note: The 14900K is only able to hit 6GHz under single-threaded workloads without manual tweaking of settings or overclocking. The rated peak clock speed for the chip gets gradually reduced as more cores are activated, as is typical, with the max clock speed achievable with all cores active on the 14900K set to 5.6GHz, versus the 13900K's 5.4GHz. None of the secondary characteristics of the processor was improved with the refresh line, either. The Core i9-14900K and the Core i9-13900K both have identical memory controllers with a max officially supported DDR5 clock speed of 5,600MHz. The integrated graphics processor (IGP) likewise remains unchanged, with both relying on Intelâs UHD Graphics 770. This IGP has 32 execution units (EUs) and operates at 1.65GHz on both chips. At this point, you might assume that the Core i9-13900K and Core i9-14900K would perform more or less the same in all of our tests, and you would be right! But letâs take a look at the test scores to demonstrate exactly how similar these processors are. The Core i9-14900K is an LGA 1700 processorâjust the same as all other Intel 12th Gen Alder Lake and Intel 13th Gen Raptor Lake processorsâand as such all of these processors can work on the same motherboard. I used a Gigabyte Z790 Aorus Master motherboard to test the Core i9-14900K and cooled the processor with a 240mm Cooler Master MasterLiquid PL240 Flux water cooler. The system was also equipped with two 16GB sticks of DDR5 RAM in a dual-channel configuration. This RAM was operated at 5,600MHz, which is the Core i9-14900Kâs max officially supported clock speed. The test system was built onto an open-air Praxis Wetbench chassis and powered by a SilverStone DA850 PSU. All tests were performed inside of Windows 11 with all updates installed. I also added an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 to the system for all tests except the IGP tests. Using a more powerful graphics card for this purpose may help us to better gauge absolute peak gaming performance for the processors, but very, very few users will shell out for a card in the price class of an RTX 4090 ($1,500-plus). By using a card at the RTX 3080 level, we instead are able to learn something else. Most gamers are running with significantly weaker graphics hardware than even an RTX 3080, with cards like the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 and GeForce RTX 3060 being crowd favorites according to the monthly Steam Hardware Survey. (In contrast, the RTX 4090 and AMD's top-end Radeon RX 7900 XTX are used jointly by less than 1% of Steam users.) The RTX 3080 is significantly faster than cards like the RTX 1060 and RTX 3060, but by using it for testing we gain an idea how much processing power you need to run a GPU with performance on par with the RTX 3080. At the same time, in cases where we don't see any benefit from a faster processor, we can safely say you also wouldn't see a benefit from using those faster processors with a GTX 1060 or RTX 3060. While we could test with an RTX 4090, like many other publications do, we find this at the time to be more informative for real-world upgraders on limited budgets. Kicking things off with AIDA64âs memory and cache bandwidth test enables us to gain some insight into the processorâs internal bandwidth. This is crucial as changes in bandwidth can significantly alter performance in many other categories, and knowing how much bandwidth is available among the various pools of memory can help us to understand why a processor performs the way it does in various tests. The Core i9-14900K performed quite well in these tests, with measured bandwidth close to the top of the charts. It was not strictly the fastest, as it was slightly outpaced by 14700K and the 13900K in the memory bandwidth department. It did also show significantly slower L2 bandwidth than many competing AMD chips, but this is made up for somewhat by leading L1 performance and the fastest L3 read speeds. Itâs with the CPU tests that we start to see the head-scratching side of the Core i9-14900K. In Cinebench, it was behind the 13900K in the multi-threaded test, likely due to overheating and throttling faster. Both chips hit 100 degrees C in this test, but the Core i9-14900K's higher turbo causes it to overheat faster and more frequently. The single-threaded performance was slightly better, though, thanks to the higher turbo, and led the field here: a definite bright spot. Performance in Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Premiere Pro both increased for the 14900K over the 13900K, but only by a relatively small margin. HandBrake, Blender, and POV-Ray all reported near-identical results for the 14900K and the 13900K. The competing AMD chips were left quite a ways behind, with a 7% advantage at minimum for the 14900K against all of the tested AMD processors, and in most cases the advantage was significantly greater. Testing with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 in gaming tests pushes the processors closer together with less chance to stand out. Nonetheless, the Core i9-14900K managed impressive results in 3DMarkâs Time Spy test. It would be even more impressive if it werenât beaten by the Core i7-14700K. In F1 22, the 14900K performed about the same as most of the other tested Intel chips, but it also held a notable 6% advantage over the competing AMD Ryzen 9 7950X at 1080p resolutions. This advantage disappeared against the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D, though. We saw something similar in Bioshock: Infinite with an 8% advantage for the 14900K, this time with the resolution set to 1080p, which shrinks to barely more than a 3% advantage against the 7950X3D. In the other games we tested, the 14900K turned in generally similar results to its closest competition without any of the chips showing a notable advantage. The integrated graphics unit on the 14900K is the same one used on all of the Intel chips tested here, and all of the tested AMD chips likewise use the same respective IGP. This creates a relatively even testing environment where the IGP performance is generally what pushes a CPU up or down in these tests. In F1 22, we recorded relatively similar results overall from most of the tested chips, with only the Core i5-14600K and the Core i9-12900K standing out for being a bit slower. Things changed significantly in Total War: Three Kingdoms, where the Intel chips took a significant performance lead, and the 14900K and 13900K stood out as slightly faster than the rest of the pack. This trend continued in Bioshock: Infinite with the 14900K now standing out as the single fastest chip tested. In Tomb Raider, the 13900K caught back up with the 14900K, but these two chips were still ever so slightly ahead of the other Intel chips and a sizable step ahead of the AMD competition. We use a Kill-A-Watt wall meter to test the power consumption of the test systems' power draw as a whole. Though this doesnât give us an exact measure of the power consumed by the processor being tested, we are able to get a rough idea. With its 6GHz clock speed, itâs no surprise that the 14900K is the power-hungriest chip in our lineup, and it even pulled a fair bit more power than the otherwise identical 13900K. It's obvious that the AMD chips are far less power-hungry, and though they werenât as fast in many of our tests, the data we have suggests that the AMD chips are considerably more efficient in terms of how much work you get out of them per watt. You won't find much to say in response to the thermal tests, as almost all of the AMD and Intel chips hit their thermal limit under load with our testbed's 240mm water cooler. If you plan to buy any of these chips, you may want to consider a 360mm water cooler, though that may not be enough to avoid thermal throttling in all cases, either. Overall, Intelâs new Intel Core i9-14900K is a powerful processor that led our test charts with impressive performance numbers. It runs hot and consumes a lot of power, but it's priced aggressively against the Ryzen 9 competition, making it worth considering. However, this feels all too familiar: Thatâs almost exactly what we said last year in our Intel Core i9-13900K review. Of course, the existence of that other processor requires that we recommend the Core i9-14900K with some caveats. First, the general consideration is that you donât want to buy the 14900K if you plan to build a compact system with limited thermal headroom or a lower-wattage power supply. Next, you shouldnât buy the 14900K if you can buy a 13900K for less. Realistically, these are the same processors, leaving little reason to recommend one over the other. You'll find a few minor differences, most notable among them that the 13900K should work on all Intel 700-series motherboards without the need of a BIOS update, whereas the 14900K likely will need a BIOS update. Another is that the Core i9-14900K has the potential to overclock slightly better, but this may not even be true. Looking at overclocking records for the Core i9-13900K, we see many of the records were set by people overclocking the processor between 6GHz and 6.6GHz while using extreme cooling techniques like dry ice. When professional overclockers need to resort to extreme cooling just to scale past 6GHz, it's doubtful you will get very much past 6GHz with ordinary-civilian cooling gear. Given the option, we would opt for the 13900K if the two were the same price, as better support is more important than marginal and possibly non-existent overclocking gains. That's the biggest issue for the 14900K: Itâs not markedly better than the 13900K. So long as the 13900K is available, and especially if it is selling for a lower price, thatâs the better processor to buy. Intel's Core i9-14900K processor is essentially the Core i9-13900K with a slight clock boost, but a bit more prone to overheating and throttling. If you can find a 13900K for less money, opt for it, as the 14900K is much the same chip in practice.

intel-i9-14900K,tomshardware,"Here we can see how the 14th-gen chips stack up against AMD's Ryzen family. The Core i9-14900K wields the same eight hyperthreaded Raptor Cove P-cores (performance) and 16 single-threaded E-cores as the Core i9-13900K, but Intel increased the base/boost speeds by 100 to 200 MHz. As mentioned, the Core i7-14700K gains four more E-cores and a 200 MHz higher boost frequency for the P-cores, along with a 100 MHz increase to the E-core boost speed.

The Core i5-14600K gets the smallest of improvements over the previous-gen 13600K, with a mere 100 MHz increase to the E-core boost clocks. As you would expect, we only saw slight performance gains over the 13600K in our testing, so this chip would be a tough sell to an upgrader who could instead opt for a previous-gen model for less cash.

Intel also offers all three chips in graphics-less KF-series configurations for slightly less cash than their full-featured counterparts. In contrast to prior generations, Intel will forge all three of its K-series models from the same die instead of relying upon a cut-down die for some Core i5 SKUs.

Intel hasn't detailed the improvements it made to the 'Intel 7' node, but we do know that it has an enhanced voltage/frequency curve that allows Intel to deliver the increased clocks within the same official power specifications as the prior gen. As usual, your cooling solution will play a big part in your attainable boost speeds â Intel recommends a 360mm-class radiator for the best performance with the higher-tier models.

The 14th-Gen chips are backward compatible with existing 600- and 700-series motherboards and LGA1700 coolers, and motherboard vendors have released a refreshed lineup of Z790 boards along with the new chips. Many of these new models tout more robust power delivery along with Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, and USB Gen 3.2 connectivity.

Intel continues to support dual-channel DDR4-3200 and up to DDR5-5600 for 1DPC (1R/2R) and DDR5-4400 for 2DPC (1 DIMM) setups, but says that P-core, E-core, and memory overclocking are improved. A range of new XMP kits will also arrive soon with up to DDR5-8000 speeds, and specialty (and probably exceptionally pricey) XMP kits will even range up to DDR5-8600. However, Intel notes that DDR5-6000 to DDR5-6600 remains the sweet spot for the best price-to-performance ratio. We also have to caution that the bleeding-edge kits require expensive motherboards, and not all integrated memory controllers (IMC) are created equal â you'll likely need some luck in the silicon lottery to reach the highest peak memory speeds.

This large advantage is amazing but doesn't represent Ryzen 7000X3D's performance in most titles. It also illustrates how outliers can make the X3D seem more impressive in cumulative measurements. It's worth noting that Borderlands 3 was an AMD promotional title, and that likely plays a role in its performance. The 14900K is fast enough at this title to land within a few imperceptible fps of the Ryzen 9 7950X3D. As we've seen over several of these benchmarks, you'll have to look much lower on the chart than the Core chips to find the standard Ryzen 7000 models. Far Cry 6 was another AMD-promoted game, though only the 7800X3D truly excels thanks to its single-CCD design. The 7900X3D and 7950X3D hold slim leads over the 14900K, with the latter being more prone to lower minimum FPS. The non-X3D Ryzen chips again land below most of the Core chips. Hitman 3 leverages Intel's E-cores for certain game functions, but it's clear that it also loves Ryzen X3D's voluminous L3 cache. Again, the Intel processors maintain impressive leads over the standard Ryzen 7000 models.  Minecraft can be taxing on the CPU in some scenarios, and here we've devised a CPU benchmark by leveraging the built-in test in the Portal Pioneers RTX ray-tracing benchmark. However, we disable ray-tracing to limit the GPU overhead during this test and dial up the render distance to the maximum 95 chunks â though we also dial up the resolution to 4K, since Minecraft runs at your desktop resolution. Then we simply hop into the minecart and take a ride around the track, which gives us a nice repeatable scene for benchmarking.

The Intel chips largely lead the Ryzen contenders, but the Ryzen 7 7800X3D once again proves impressive with its single-CCD design. As you can see, Minecraft's engine doesn't mesh as well with the dual-CCD Ryzen 9 7950X and 7900X.  Microsoft Flight Simulator 2021 obviously benefits tremendously from L3 cache âRyzen 7000X3D is simply incredible in this title. This is the exception rather than the rule, but for cases like this, AMD's X3D chips can run over 25% faster than Intel's chips at 1080p and 1440p. Watch Dogs Legion also favors AMD's X3D chips â not by quite the large margins as Flight Simulator, but the 7950X3D this time comes out on top, while the 7800X3D lands between that and the 7900X3D. Here's a fun little benchmark â I've been toying with different Factorio benchmarking parameters to build out a test. This remains a work in progress and doesn't impact our cumulative measurements, but it does show that there are plenty of examples of engines that prefer access to a massive L3 cache... and a single-CCD design. We can boil down productivity application performance into two broad categories: single- and multi-threaded. These slides show the geometric mean of performance in several of our most important tests in each category, but be sure to look at the expanded results below.

We're switching focus a bit with this selection of tests â we're highlighting AMD's standard Ryzen 7000 chips as they're more fit for heavy productivity work. As you'll see, the X3D chips aren't quite as good of a bang for your buck if you're more interested in productivity work.

The Ryzen 9 7950X is ~2% faster than the Core i9-14900K in our cumulative measurement of multi-threaded workloads. That means these chips are closely enough matched that you'll see them trade blows throughout our threaded benchmarks below. However, the 14900K is 18% faster than the Ryzen 9 7950X in single-threaded work, which typically equates to a snappier system. High single-threaded performance is also advantageous for complex workflows that have diverse requirements.

The Core i9-14900K only beats its predecessor, the 13900K, by 1% in multi-threaded applications and 3% in single-threaded applications, showing that it isn't worthy of a direct-gen-on-gen upgrade. In fact, it doesn't do much to change the competitive positioning of the Core i9 K-series.

The Core i5-14600K shows a bit more uplift over the 13600K â it's 4% faster in single- and multi-threaded work. However, the 13600K is currently ~$35 less expensive than the 14600K, and that gap might increase over time. Again, this chip is ever-so-slightly better, but that also doesn't do much to change the competitive landscape versus Ryzen.

The Core i7-14700K is the real standout here. Courtesy of the additional E-cores, it's 14% faster in threaded work than the 14600K, and it's also 10% faster than the competing Ryzen 9 7900X.

The Core i7 lineup has slowly crept closer to Core i9 over the years in gaming, essentially landing within a few percentage points of performance for ~$180 less. Here we can see that creep happening in threaded applications, too: The previous-gen 13900K was 28% faster than the 13700K, but the 14900K is only 14% faster than the 14700K. In tandem with the very similar gaming performance, the Core i7 is now an even more stellar deal if you're looking for a solid, affordable all-rounder.  We've added Cinebench 2024 to our benchmark suite, but we're also keeping Cinebench R23 around for historical perspective. The Core i9-14900K delivers strong performance in this benchmark, but the Ryzen 9 7950X tends to outperform in Blender.

Overall, these two chips are closely matched in terms of threaded horsepower. You'll also notice that the 13900K often slightly edges out the 14900K, but that's because the two chips are nearly identical â at times, the difference can land within the standard deviation of the benchmark, especially if its a workload that's sensitive to cache or memory throughput.

The Core i7-14700K shows its chops, widening Core i7's lead over the 7900X throughout the threaded workloads.  Most encoders tend to be either heavily threaded or almost exclusively single-threaded â it takes an agile chip to master both disciplines. Handbrake, SVT-HEVC, and SVT-AV1 serve as our threaded encoders, while LAME, FLAC, and WebP are indicative of how the chips handle lightly-threaded engines. This selection of tests runs the gamut from massively parallel molecular dynamics simulation code in NAMD to compression/decompression performance. Y-cruncher computes Pi with the AVX instruction set, making for an exceedingly demanding benchmark. This benchmark was recently updated with specific tuning for AMD's AVX-512 implementation, and here we can see the new code delivering a big boost to Ryzen. Unfortunately for us, power increases in a non-linear fashion as a chip nears the top of its absolute capabilities â in other words, you have to pump in increasingly higher amounts of voltage to extract smaller gains. Nowhere is that more evident than the trajectory from Alder Lake to Raptor Lake, and now the Raptor Lake Refresh.

As you can see, the 14th-gen processors pull far more power than the 13th-gen models, with a peak of 385W with the Core i9-14900K, though average power use was lower at 339W over the benchmark run. That amount of power consumption generates a tremendous amount of heat, so thermals will limit your performance if you don't invest in a robust cooler. As we saw with Raptor Lake, Intel's boosting mechanism will push power as far as it can go while staying under the chip's maximum allowable temperature â those power limits are just higher now. Intel's Raptor Lake drew more power than its predecessor, but the performance gains worked out to be a net win for power efficiency. As you can see in our renders-per-day-per watt power efficiency chart, the 14th-gen chips have sacrificed that efficiency entirely to eke out single-digit-percentage performance gains. Meanwhile, the 7000X3D chips run at lower frequencies than their standard Ryzen 7000 counterparts, a necessity due to their fragile 3D-stacked cache, but that results in exceptional power efficiency.  The final image takes a slightly different look at power consumption by calculating the cumulative energy required to execute an x265 HandBrake workload. We plot this 'task energy' value in Kilojoules on the left side of the chart.

These workloads are comprised of a fixed amount of work, so we can plot the task energy against the time required to finish the job (bottom axis), thus generating a really useful power chart. Bear in mind that faster compute times and lower task energy requirements are ideal. That means processors that fall the closest to the bottom left corner of the chart are the best.  The 14th-gen Raptor Lake Refresh Core i9-14900K and Core i5-1600K processors provide slim upgrades over the 13th-gen models and don't materially change the overall competitive landscape. In contrast, the Core i7-14700K's four extra E-cores provide a tangible uplift in threaded applications that improves Core i7's overall value proposition.

Below, we have the geometric mean of our gaming test suite at 1080p and 1440p and a cumulative measure of performance in single- and multi-threaded applications. We conducted our gaming tests with an Nvidia RTX 4090, so performance deltas will shrink with lesser cards and higher resolution and fidelity settings. The above slides are cumulative measurements, and the Ryzen 7000X3D's 3D V-Cache tech doesnât accelerate all titles equally â you should check our individual game and productivity benchmarks in the preceding sections to make an informed decision based on your workload.

The Core i9-14900K is a lackluster refresh for gamers and 'regular' users alike, with gen-on-gen gains in both gaming and productivity applications often landing in the low single-digit percentages. For instance, the 14900K is a mere 3% faster than the previous-gen 13900K in 1080p gaming, and that isn't nearly enough to cover the large gap between it and the Ryzen 7000X3D processors. For now, the Ryzen 7000X3D lineup remains the fastest overall gaming chips on the market.

However, while the Core i9-14900K isn't the king of the hill for gaming, the Ryzen 7000X3D processors tend to lag in productivity applications. AMD has its lineup of standard Ryzen 7000 processors for those use cases, leaving customers to choose between two lineups with drastically different strengths. In contrast, the 14900K offers a better blend of performance in both disciplines. If you're in need of a strong all-rounder, the Core i9-14900K fits the bill, just as the Core i9-13900K does now.

However, Intel had to increase power consumption yet again to eke out those tiny performance gains â power increases non-linearly when you're at the top of the voltage/frequency curve â and that means the Core i9-14900K will require pricey supporting componentry, like a robust cooler, motherboard, and power supply, to extract the best performance. If you decide on a 14900K, make sure to take those additional costs into consideration.

The Core i5-14600K only brings 100 extra MHz of E-core boost clocks to the table, and that isn't enough to make a substantial difference to its competitive positioning, either. The previous-gen 13600K has been on sale for as low as $285, or roughly $35 less, muddying the water for potential upgraders. However, as with the 14900K, the chip does offer a balanced performance profile that some will find attractive. It's just the exact same profile as before.

We don't know the exact timeline of AMD's next desktop processor release or how those chips will perform. As a result, across the full breadth of the stack, the 'refreshed' picture seems pretty similar to what we saw with the original Raptor Lake chips: If gaming is all you care about, go with an X3D chip if you can afford it. If you're looking for a balanced chip that can handle gaming and excel at productivity-focused work, too, the Raptor Lake (and Refresh) chips are a good choice. However, the generational difference between the Core i5 and i9 chips is so small that upgraders will be better off buying an older chip when it inevitably goes on sale.

In contrast, the Core i7-14700K looks more attractive than the Core i9 and i5 models. It's tangibly faster than the older 13700K, thus earning its higher price tag, and it's also faster than the competing productivity-focused chip from AMD. It's also only 3% slower than the 14900K in gaming but costs $180 less. Finally, the four extra E-cores make it much closer to the 14900K in productivity apps now, delivering a solid price-to-performance ratio that will undoubtedly cannibalize Intel's Core i9 sales."
